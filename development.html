                                The framework has been developed following the passage of CRAG's Proposal H
                                at the May 2017 Central Council meeting.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Proposal H stated that: 'The Decisions of the Central Council will be replaced with a simple
                                and permissive descriptive framework for ringing with only the minimal detail required to
                                maintain the historical record. The Executive will appoint a neutral and respected ringer
                                who is demonstrably independent of those responsible for the current Decisions to complete
                                this work. The leader may assemble a group of ringers to assist with this task and will consult
                                widely on their proposals before presenting them to the Council in May 2018.
                                The publication and maintenance of this framework will be the responsibility of the Executive.'

                                Tim Barnes was appointed by Christopher O'Mahony, CC President, to lead the development of the
                                framework. Two groups were formed:
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                - A drafting group comprising Tim Barnes, Mark Davies, John Harrison, Graham John and Philip Saddleton
                                developed the initial, draft language for the framework.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                - A review group comprising Philip Earis, Andrew Johnson, Don Morrison,
                                Peter Scott, Leigh Simpson, Richard Smith, Derek Williams and Robin Woolley reviewed
                                the draft language and provided feedback.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Broader consultations were then held with the ringing community
                                to gather feedback and further refine the framework.

                                Description not prescription (the 'permissive' part of the CRAG proposal): Avoid arbitrary rules
                                and value judgements.  Seek to find the logical boundaries that define the limits of method
                                ringing, and ensure the framework supports everything within these boundaries.
                                The boundaries used are shown in Section B below.

                                Simple, generic and consistent (the 'simple' part of the CRAG proposal): The more
                                straightforward the framework is, the more widely it will be understood across the ringing
                                community and the more accessible it will be to new ringers joining the Exercise.
                                Standardise terms and requirements where this increases simplicity while retaining historical meaning.
                                However, it is also recognised that method ringing has inherent complexity resulting from both its
                                mathematical foundation and its rich history, such that not all complexity can be eliminated.

                                The scope of the framework is method ringing (also called scientific ringing).
                                It does not cover call (or called) changes, nor tune ringing.
                                Cylindrical ringing, where a bell can ring twice in some Rows, and not at all in others, is similarly
                                out of scope.

                                A Change may be any transformation of one Row to the next.  This results in the definition of
                                Jump Changes and Identity Changes in the framework.
                                The term 'Adjacent Change' has also been introduced to be equivalent to the previous definition of 'change' in Decision (E) A.1.

                                Any sequence of Changes should be able to be named as a Method.

                                The location of individual Rows within a Block of Rows does not have any bearing on truth.

                                then this Place is also a Fixed Place and is excluded when determining truth.

                                The Conditions for Peal Ringing in the current Decision (D) are being replaced by Performance Reporting
                                requirements. Under this new permissive framework, bands decide what they wish to ring,
                                and the onus is on them to determine if a Performance merits publication.
                                The Performance Reporting requirements include disclosures for when the ringing is not
                                covered by the framework, or when it is covered by the framework but includes
                                characteristics that differ from established norms (for example, not starting and ending in Rounds).
                                These disclosures can then be used in subsequent analyses of ringing Performances.
