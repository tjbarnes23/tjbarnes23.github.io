                                Some of the processes involve setting parameters (e.g. a mode), which are chosen by the Method designer.
                                Different Extensions can result depending on the parameters used.
                                Method designers should decide which process, and where applicable, which process parameters, to use to obtain their desired Extension.

                            <p>
                                The prerequisites for this process are as follows:
                            </p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    The Parent Method is a Little Method, a Principle, or a Differential that is not a Hunter.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The Parent Method does not use Jump Changes and is not a Dynamic Method.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                             <p>

                            <p>
                                The steps to implement this process are shown using the following example where Little Bob Minor is the Parent Method:
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <img src="images\extensionprocesses\example-1-1.svg" width=806 height=241 />  
                            </p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Select a mode m, where m is between 1 and the Stage of the Parent Method, inclusive.
                                    In the example above, the selected mode is 4.
                                </li>
                                
                                <li>
                                    Divide the place notation (shown in column pn) of the Parent Method into Places up to and including the mode,
                                    and Places above the mode.  These Places are entered in the columns headed <=m and >m respectively.                                    
                                </li>
                                
                                <li>
                                    To obtain the first Extension (which is two Stages higher = Major), leave the Places in column <=m unchanged,
                                    and increase the Places in column >m by two.  See the box for Major above.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    Then recombine the Places in column <=m and column >m to obtain the place notation for the Extension to Major.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    The above can be repeated to obtain additional Extensions in steps of 2 Stages, as shown above for Royal and Maximus.
                                </li>

                                An Extension produced using Extension Process 1 is only valid if:

                                    The Extension has the same symmetry as the Parent Method.

                                    The Extension has the same number of Cycles of Working Bells as the Parent Method.<br />
                                    The exception to this requirement is that if a Parent Method has one Cycle of Working Bells
                                    and the Extension has more than one Cycle, and each Cycle has the same number of Working Bells,
                                    then this is considered valid.

                                    If the Parent Method has Cyclic Lead-Heads, the Extension also has Cyclic Lead-Heads.<br />
                                    If the Parent Method does not have any of the Lead-Head types above, the Extension also does not have any of the Lead-Head types above.

                                    So Little Bob Minor is extended using process 1/4.

                                Process 2 extends a parent method that has one or more hunt bells by adding an additional hunt bell.
                                The extension is one stage higher than the parent, and the lead length is two changes longer.
                                Most commonly this extension process is used to extend a parent method with one hunt bell to a twin hunt method.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However, this process can also be used to extend a twin hunt parent method to a method with three hunt bells, and so on.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Prerequisites for this process are as follows:
                            </p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    The hunt bell(s) follow a Plain Hunting path (i.e. the path consists of hunting up to nth's place, making nth's, hunting down to mth's place, making mth's).
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    If the parent method has more than one plain hunting bell, they must all be coursing, meaning they each have the same path but visit each place two rows later than an earlier hunt bell.
                                </li>
                                
                                <li>
                                    No places are made above a hunt bell place that transitions the hunt bell from hunting up to hunting down.
                                </li>

                                    No places are made below a hunt bell place that transitions the hunt bell from hunting down to hunting up.
                                </li>

                                    The parent method does not use jump changes.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                                The steps to implement this process are shown in the following example:

                                The designated code for referring to this process is "2". For example, St Simon's Bob Doubles is extended to St Simon's Bob Minor using process 2.

                                Process 3 extends a parent method by replicating and possibly expanding some of its changes.
                                This process is designed primarily to extend parent methods that have one Plain or Treble Dodging
                                hunt bell, or an Alliance path that comprises Hunting and Treble Dodging.

                                b is the beginning location of the section to be copied, and e is the ending location of the section to be copied.
                                Below the treble, b and e are numbered starting from the half-lead change and working back towards the start of the lead.
                                The half-lead change is numbered 0, the change before the half-lead is numbered 1, and so on.
                                Above the treble, b and e are numbered starting from the lead end change and working forwards towards the half lead.
                                The lead end change is numbered 0, the change after the lead end is numbered 1, and so on.

                                s is the step size.

                                The section before the colon refers to below the treble, and the section after the colon refers to above the treble.
                                For example, Milton Surprise Minor is extended using process 3/4-7/2/2:4-7/2/2.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When the same results are obtained by copying different sections, designate the section closest to the half lead (below the treble)
                                or closest to the lead end (above the treble) as the one that was copied.  E.g. in Milton Surprise Minor, if section 0-3 was copied
                                instead of 4-7 (both below and above the treble), the same results would be obtained.  Therefore Milton should be described as
                                being extended using process 3/0-3/2/2:0-3/2/2.  (The earlier section was used in the example to show what happens after the copied section.)
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When two or more different modes give the same results, designate the mode used as the lowest one.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Plain methods are usually extended by copying a 2-change section and using a step size of 2.
                                Treble Dodging methods are usually extended by copying a 4-change section and using a step size of 2.
                                Both of these extend the parent method by two stages.
                                But other combinations are possible.  E.g. for a treble dodging method, an 8-change section may be copied, and a step size of 4 used.
                                This would result in the extension being 4 stages higher than the parent.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Different length sections may be copied below and above the treble.  For example, in a treble dodging method,
                                an 8-change section may be copied, and a step size of 4 used, below the treble.
                                Above the treble, a 4-change section may be copied, and a step size of 2 used.
                                In order to extend the lead length by the same amount below and above, the process above the treble would need to be applied twice
                                for every one time the process below the treble is applied.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Finally, the example and descriptions above assume the parent method is symmetrical about the lead end and half-lead changes.
                                For asymmetric methods, process 3 may be applied separately in both halves of the lead.  However, the same mode must be
                                used below the treble in both halves of the lead, and the same mode must be used above the treble in both halves of the lead.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If the asymmetry applies only to the places below the treble, or only to the places above the treble (i.e. the other is symmetrical),
                                process 3 is applied separately in both halves for the asymmetric places, and only once for the symmetric places (in order to retain
                                that symmetry).
                            </p>
