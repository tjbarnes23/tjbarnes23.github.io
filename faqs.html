                                No. The reason this isn't needed is because alternative B always classifies a hunter based on the path of the treble, regardless of how many hunt bells there are. This is viewed as aligning more closely with the historic terms used -- treble bob, treble dodging, treble place.

                                Agree they weren't easy to compare as presented -- apologies for that.  As noted in the [add date] RW article,
                                we have now settled on a classification proposal to put forward -- it falls somewhere between Alt A and
                                Alt B, and is the single classification section now included in this website.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However, we will still aim to put together a table that compares the classifications used in the Decisions,

                                We intend Hunting, as a standalone term, to mean hunting in a single direction (i.e. either hunting up or hunting down).
                                The main use of hunting is in the definition of a Place method, in which the paths of all the bells consist only of Hunting and Making Places.

                                This is distinct from a Plain Hunt Path (or Plain Hunting Path), which consists of hunting up, making a place, hunting down and making another place.
                                While Plain Hunt Path isn't a term we needed to define for use elsewhere,
                                we've now included this term in the further explanation of the Plain Method class definition (see Section 4.D.1).

                                Reports of peals in the RW now refer to cyclical and particles and it would be helpful to the rank and file ringers

                                Words have been capitalized in the framework when they are a specialist ringing term that is defined elsewhere in the framework
                                (per Section 2.A.5).  A better approach might be to italicize the words rather than capitalize them,
                                and make them hyperlinks to the definition in question (which also gives the option of presenting them underlined or in a different color).
                                As noted elsewhere, there is various scope for improving the appearance of the framework website -- this is something we plan to look at for

                                Identity was chosen because it's used in mathematics to denote an operation that, when applied to an input, produces an output that is the same as the input.
                                E.g. the identity for addition is zero, because n + 0 = n.  In change ringing, we apply a change to a row in order to produce a new row, so it's
                                consistent to call the change that results in a new row that's the same as the previous row the identity change.
                                'Null change' has also been used in the past for the identity change.  A discussion about this in the ringing-theory email group indicated a preference for identity over null.

                                The are various terms in method ringing that have similar meanings (e.g. touch and composition),
                                as well as terms that have more than one meaning (e.g. lead can refer to ringing in 1st's place or a lead of a method).
                                We've tried to distinguish similar terms as best we can:
                                We view a method as just the sequence of changes, without considering the rows that the method can be used to generate.<br />
                                A block, on the other hand, results from applying a sequence of changes (i.e. a method or a composition) to a starting row (normally rounds).
                                A block therefore comprises a set of rows and the changes used to generate them.<br />
                                Related to these terms, a touch is a block generated by a composition,
                                and a plain lead and a plain course are blocks generated by a single method without any calls.

                                We considered this, but the difficulty is that there will be lots of different views on where
                                to draw the line between vanilla and exotic.

                                <i>I was unclear about the use of stage at various points in the framework.
                                There seem to be requirements of various terms to be all “of the same stage” which did not make sense to my mind as it
                                precluded blocks/compositions of spliced triples and major (given the commonplace understanding of the term “stage”).
                                However, an explanation is found hidden away in explanatory notes for cover bells.
                                I think that something should be done to enable a clearer understanding of this concept in the main text,
                                especially as various sections of the explanatory notes relate; not everything is one place.
                                (I also do not understand why Plain Bob Doubles/Plain Bob Minor rung side by side on 12 produces Maximus changes
                                as there are 11 bells affected by the method – so surely this would be cinques changes
                                as per the example given elsewhere of Plain Bob Minor/Plain Bob Cinques rung side by side).</i>

                                A few people commented that the use of 'stage' in the framework wasn't clear to them,
                                and/or that the information on 'stage' is too fragmented across the framework.
                                Because stage is a concept that applies to various other concepts (rows, changes, blocks,
                                methods and compositions), organizing the information can become circular
                                (e.g. the definition of method involves stage, but defining stage without referring to method
                                can be too abstract).
                                To try and address this, we've now added Appendix [n] that discusses all aspects of Stage,
                                and the various sections of the framework that use stage all now refer to this appendix.

                                On the question about Doubles / Minor rung side by side on 12 bells,
                                this would indeed normally result in Cinques changes, which could then be 
                                rung (say) with the 12th as a cover bell.
                                But in the example in the technical comment of 3.H.1, the Doubles is being rung
                                on bells 1-5, and the Minor is being ruing on bells 7-12, with 6th's place containing
                                a cover bell.
                                For practical purposes (e.g. when entering changes into a proving program),
                                the changes would most likely be specificed as Maximus changes, with a place notation of "6"
                                included in every change.
                                But the effective stage of the block produced by these changes would still be Cinques (assuming there are no other
                                fixed places).

                                I wondered if it should be the 1st row as if you start a touch in rounds, the first change takes you to the first non-rounds touch of the composition;
                                therefore is the initial row really part of the composition?

                                We debated this point when drafting the framework.
                                The reality is that when determining the truth of a round block, you can exclude 
                                either the initial row or the final row (these two rows being the same).
                                We felt that using either/or language throughout the framework would be a little cumbersome,
                                so decided to standardize on including the initial row and excluding the final row,
                                because this often aligns with the symmetry of what is being rung.
                                But in practice the other approach will also be useful.
                                E.g. when judging a striking competition, if the rules call for not judging the opening
                                and closing rounds, the judge probably won't know the touch has started until she hears
                                a non-rounds row.  So in this scenario, it would make sense to exclude the initial row
                                and include the final row for judging purposes.

                                Yes, 'same set of methods' is referring to multi-method performances (which are often, but not always, spliced).
                                A method is always defined at the level of its method title.
                                For example, Cambridge Surprise Minor and Cambridge Surprise Major are not the same method --
                                they are two different methods that are related (via a method extension process).
                                Similarly Yorkshire Surprise Major and Yorkshire Delight Major
                                are also two different methods -- ones that happen to share the same method name.
                                We've amended 9.B.1 to clarify the above, and have also added that
                                variations can also be used to generate a unique set of methods / variations for which to ring
                                to a record length.

                                and have used your example that 2nd's place bell in Bristol Surprise Major can be said to be a little path.

                                Our concern here relates to handbell performances where each ringer only rings one bell.
                                While these are rung infrequently, we wanted the framework to be able to accurately
                                describe them if they are rung.
                                BellBoard today has one form for one-bell-per-ringer, and another form for two-bells-per-ringer.
                                A one-bell-per-ringer handbell performance could therefore look like a tower bell performance,
                                so 6.B.1 e) gives a requirement to footnote that such a performance was on handbells.
                                We've now edited 6.B.1 to include this point.

                                Yes agreed -- multi-method performances posted on BellBoard often include the number of methods in the performance title.
                                We've now updated 6.A to cover this, but made it optional as to where the number of methods is put,
                                noting that The Ringing World still includes this in the performance detail.

                                Agreed. We've now added a definition of variable cover as part of 3.H (Cover Bells).
                                Like spliced, variable cover is an attribute of a composition, so we've also now stated
                                that a performance title includes 'variable cover' if the performance included ringing a variable cover composition.

                                4.A.7 defines Hunting.  We intend Hunting, as a standalone term, to mean hunting in a single direction (i.e. either hunting up or hunting down).
                                The main use of hunting is in the definition of a Place method, in which the paths of all the bells consist only of Hunting and Making Places.
                                This is distinct from a Plain Hunt Path (we assume this is what you meant, as opposed to a Treble Bob Hunt Path),
                                which consists of hunting up, making a place, hunting down and making another place (i.e 'both' hunting up and hunting down, per your question).
                                While Plain Hunt Path isn't a term we needed to define for use elsewhere,
                                we've now included this term in the further explanation of the Plain Method class definition (see Section 4.D.1).

                                <i>Although the meaning is clear at all times in your text, I feel that there is a potential for misunderstanding in the use of the word 'extent'.
                                It is commonly used to mean (eg on 5) "all 120 possible changes rung consecutively".
                                Thus "call two extents of Grandsire Doubles" would widely be interpreted to mean calling a 120 then another 120 immediately following,
                                while a 240 that has each row once at hand and once at back would more often be called a "double-extent".
                                But in your usage this 240 could be called "two extents" as each change occurs twice, but the two extents are intertwined.
                                You seem to anticipate this possible confusion by adding the clarifying remark "The location of individual Rows within a Block of Rows does not have any bearing on truth."
                                Good - but I feel there is still a need to point out these two different possible interpretations of the word "extent" - or maybe have two different words???
                                Not sure what the solution is.</i>

                                We agree ringing hasn't evolved clear terminology to differentiate between a round block comprising two extents
                                (where the rows can appear in any order), and two individual extents rung consecutively.
                                Where terminology like this hasn't evolved, it generally means that either the distinction isn't important,
                                or the distinction can be made using ordinary dictionary words (such as 'two individual extents rung consecutively'
                                as above.)
                                We don't have an immediate proposal on this, but will table it as something to look at for a subsequent version
                                of the framework.

                                Yes, blocks are introduced early (3.D) but this is deliberate. We tried many different ways of organizing
                                the information to minimize the number of forward references needed, and give the most intuitive
                                groupings of terms, and we found that introducing blocks before methods, calls, compositions and cover bells gave the
                                best results.

                                The count of changes is the same regardless of whether the block is round or not.
                                But when determining truth (which is a function of rows), the final row of a non-round block must be included,
                                whereas for a round block it's excluded.

                                We're now reordered the framework so that the references to truth and accepted truth that were in 2.B.6 are now in Appendix E
                                (Framework Development). This gives a better ordering of the information.

                                There can be many different ways to apply truth (e.g. in a 240 of Doubles, each row appearing once at handstroke
                                and once at backstroke might be considered 'more true' than a 240 where each row simply appears twice).
                                In the interests of simplicity, we felt it would be valuable to have a single definition of truth that applies
                                to all stages and all lengths, hence the definition used in 3.J.4.
                                While 'complete' is a reasonably-well-known term for describing a block that contains each possible row at least once,
                                we found we didn't need 'complete' to define any other term or requirement in the framework, so in the
                                interests of simplicity, we didn't include 'complete' as a defined term.

                                Yes, both the changes and the rows.  A block results from applying a given sequence of changes to an intial row.
                                While in practice, most ringing uses rounds as the initial row, a different block could be obtained
                                from the same sequence of changes by using a different initial row.  The two blocks' changes would be the same,
                                but their rows would be different.

                                3.G.1 defines composition in terms of method(s).
                                To be fully precise, we ought to define composition in terms of both methods and variations.
                                Because it would be cumbersome to use 'methods / variations' in certain places in the framework,
                                we've just used methods, and 5.D.5 then serves to expand the earlier sections to also include variations.

                                Note that a variation isn't a composition -- it's the use of a method with certain, defined call(s).
                                You still need to come up with a composition that specifies how to use this method and its defined call(s).

                                We retained Octuples (stage 17) primarily because a peal of Octuples has been rung
                                (this is the highest odd-stage peal rung to date).
                                We didn't think nonuples was in the ringers' lexicon to the extent its
                                absence needed to be explained, espcially since even stages switch to
                                English numbering starting at stage 14.

                                The problem with the suggested definition is that "each bell" is undefined.
                                E.g. could it mean "each bell in England", or "each bell in the tower"?
                                The defining feature of a row is that no bell appears more than once,
                                regardless of which bells do appear.
                                When rows are combined into blocks, there is then an additional
                                constraint that every row in the block comprises the same set of bells.
                                This follows from the definition of change as a transposition.
                                To clarify this point, we've now added further explanations to 3.C.1 and 3.D.1.

                                Agreed on the first point. In practice, we don't expect identity and jump changes to be rung
                                frequently, so in normal usage, 'adjacent change' will probably be abbreviated to 'change',
                                and the meaning will be clear from the context.

                                Calls are separate from methods, in the sense that a given call can be used with many different methods,
                                and many different calls can be used with a single method.
                                However, when reporting the number of changes rung of a given method in a performance,
                                the count includes those changes that were modifications to the method's changes resulting from calls.

                                Ringing a 18 change in Cambridge is an example of the well-known problem of overlap in describing method ringing.
                                The same set of changes can be described in many different ways, and there's no satisfactory way of eliminating
                                this overlap.
                                Ringers therefore use their judgement to decide which is the most meaningful way of describing a given set of changes.
                                A 18 change in Cambridge could be described as a composition of spliced Cambridge and Primrose,
                                or the 18 change could be described as an additional call in a Cambridge composition.

                                could be reported as 1440 Plain Bob Minor, thereby counting the identity changes.

                                Either approach would be valid and it is left to ringers to use their best judgement in deciding how to report.
                                Note that reporting 1440 changes would give a more expected alignment with the reported time of the performance.
                                Also note that at higher stages, whole pull ringing would almost certainly be false, leading to a disclosure
                                under 6.C.2 b).

                                it is possible for a Composition to use two or more Methods side by side,
                                or to use two or more Compositions side by side.
                                As a further variation, a Composition might also result in an interior Cover Bell.
                                For example, a Composition might be designed to be used with Maximus Rows,
                                using a Doubles Method in Places 1 to 5 and a Minor Method in Places 7 to 12.
                                6th's Place does not have any Methods operating on it, and therefore 6th's Place contains a Cover Bell.
                                In this case, the Composition would produce Maximus Changes (and therefore have a Stage of Maximus),
                                and each of its Changes would include the place notation '6'."<br />
                                I read that as being an Effective Stage of Cinques.<br />
                                I guess with fixed bells in the middle you could use jump changes to swap bells from the front to the back.</i>

                                Correct on both. The effective stage is Cinques (even though the composition has a stage of Maximus),
                                and jump changes could be used to jump between, say, 5th's place and 7th's place, thereby
                                leaving 6th's place as an interior cover bell.

                                We recognize that jump changes is a divisive topic, and some ringers don't consider them to be part of method ringing.
                                In line with our descriptive / permissive mandate, we've included jump changes in the framework.
                                But to enable ringers who object to jump changes to be able to ignore any reported performances that include them,
                                we felt disclosure was needed.  Note that since methods that include jump changes will have 'Jump' in their method
                                titles, disclosure is only required when jump calls are used with non-jump methods
                                (see the further explanation of Section 6.C.2).

                                <i>I would urge the proponents of these changes to tread very carefully indeed.
                                History shows that when traditional and ingrained systems are swept away, those who are not prepared to put up with it
                                will break away from the existing structures and form their own traditional groups.
                                Anglicanism is a good example where there are now thousands of traditionalists broken away from Lambeth throughout the world.
                                An alternative Council of Traditional English Change Ringers would be a disaster for the art given the challenges to ringing

                                the Decisions' approach of ruling out ringing that hasn't been done before has harmed the Council's reputation,
                                especially among more advanced ringers. The motion to switch to a descriptive / permissive approach
                                passed with a very clear majority at the Edinburgh CC meeting.

                                However we recognize that traditionalists won't like all the forms of method ringing that the framework describes.
                                The framework uses a disclosure approach so that performances that differed from method ringing norms
                                can be identified as such.

                                restrictions on what is considers methods or peals.
                                For example, this Society might choose to only recognize peals of Triples and below that are rung
                                in whole extents, and that only include methods that are principles or have Plain Bob leadheads / leadends.

                                Ultimately ringers with a wide range of opinions have to find ways to coexist with one another,
                                and we believe that a descriptive / permissive approach, paired with disclosure and the ability
                                of like-minded ringers to form societies that focus on the types of ringing they're interested in,
                                is the most likely way to achieve this.

                                <i>I think that what we should strive to avoid is offending against first principles of change ringing that have been established for centuries.
                                Thus I cannot support the introduction of jump changes and multiple covering bells in peals.
                                The peal is a benchmark of achievement and there is no case for allowing people who can barely handle a bell in Rounds
                                to follow another bell for three hours in the pretense that they are now a peal ringer.
                                Extra covering bells have a place in Quarters to give rope-time to learners, but not in peal ringing.
                                If this is permitted we will soon see a peal of Minimus rung on 12 with 8 covering bells which would bring our art into disrepute.</i>

                                That is a nonsense. However what I do want to see, and have advocated for many years is the acceptance of Singles.
                                I do not see a case for saying that a band who have worked away at a probably rough 3 for nearly three hours have not rung a Peal.
                                Singles should be the basic minimum stage for change ringing.</i>

                                Much Central Council time was taken up debating whether 4-bell peals should be recognized.
                                We could clearly spend more time debating whether 3-bell peals should be recognized, and then 2-bell peals.
                                Similarly, we could spend much time in the future debating whether jump changes and multiple cover bells should be recognized.
                                With the CRAG mandate, the Council has recognized this is not a good approach.
                                The mandate was very clear -- the aim of the framework is to be permissive and describe what ringers choose to ring,
                                rather than specifying rules over what the Council will and will not recognize.
                                This is a direct response by the Council to the recognition that the previoius system hasn't worked well,
                                has caused much controversy, and has harmed the Council's reputation, obscuring much of its other good work.
                                It's now time to try something new -- namely to provide standard terminology for ringers to describe what they rang,
                                and leave it to them to decide what they want to ring.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The aim of trying to use the framework to enforce ringing standards (i.e. quality) is also misguided in our view.
                                Standards vary widely by band and location, and a one-size-fits-all central approach will inevitably
                                result in the bar being set too high for some and too low for others.
                                Encouraging improved ringing quality is better addressed at the local level,
                                with the Central Council possibly providing guidance / tips, and/or promoting training events and similar.

                                This is the question of whether the identity change should be recognized.
                                For example, an extent of Plain Bob Doubles can be turned into a true 240 by calling a
                                single with place notation 12345 at two points 120 changes apart.
                                This 240 has the nice feature of every row appearing once at handstroke and once at backstroke.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Since a 12345 change results in every bell staying in the same place from one row to the next,
                                it is the identity change for Doubles.
                                Given the valid use of identity changes as in the example above, and that
                                our mandate is to be permissive and decriptive, we believe the identity
                                change should be included in the framework.  It is then up to individual
                                bands to decide whether they want to make use of it.

                                First, this is the mandate we were given, which was decided by a very clear majority vote of the Central Council.
                                Second, we agree that increasing permissiveness also increases complexity, and there's a limit to how simple
                                you can make a method ringing framework (we've interpreted the mandate as being to make the framework

                                The former is described in the futher explanation of 3.H.1.
                                The latter is an example of the well-known problem of overlap in describing method ringing.
                                You could describe a continuously leading bell in 8-bell rows as a leading cover bell rung with a Triples method,
                                or as a Major method with a stationary bell in 1st's place.
                                A leading cover bell with a Triples method might be the simpler description of what was rung, but if
                                there was also a stationary bell in, say, 5th's place, and both stationary bells were affected by calls,
                                thereby changing the stationary bells, the changes might be better described as a composition of a Major method.
                                Ringers therefore use their judgement to decide how best to describe a given set of changes.

                                The change to recognize partial extents was made in 2016, passed by a large Central Council majority, 
                                so this isn't something new in the framework.
                                To not reocognize partial extents goes against the permissive and
                                descriptive elements of the framework mandate, which was also passed by a large Central Council majority.

                                Change ringing can be viewed as having two separate branches: method ringing and call change ringing.
                                (The term 'call changes' is probably a simplification of what originally may have been 'called changes'.)
                                When looking at how the framework (and previously the Decisions) supports method ringing,
                                one finds that call change ringing doesn't require the same support.
                                There's no central library of call change callings, no tradition of publishing call change performances,
                                or ringing record lengths of call changes, and no practice of classifying call changes
                                or extending sets of call changes to give related sets at higher stages.
                                While there's no reason why the above couldn't develop, it hasn't thus far.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For the reasons above, and also so we can keep our focus on implementing the framework for method ringing sooner rather than later,
                                we therefore don't propose to include a description of call change ringing in the framework at this stage.
                                However, there may be a case for adding this in a subsequent version of the framework if the
                                ringing community thinks this would be useful.

                                A very important aspect of the new framework is that we are not seeking to allow or disallow certain
                                types of ringing.
                                Instead we are seeking to provide a common terminology that enables ringers
                                to describe what they rang, such that other ringers can read about ringing performances
                                and be clear on what was rung.
                            </p>

                                Whole pull ringing doesn't follow the norms of method ringing.
                                Under Section 6.C n) the report of a whole pull performance should therefore include a disclosure that the composition was rung in whole pulls.
                                As noted above, whole pull ringing can work well when the bells are half-muffled.

                                The framework team agrees. The first version of the framework won't be perfect,
                                and it's doubtful there could ever be a perfect framework.
                                We envisage a process of continous imrprovement to the framework over time
                                as issues and inconsistencies are discovered, and as method ringing continues to evolve.

                                <i>My own belief is that you should stop describing this work as 'technical' in the sense of difficult for ordinary people to understand.
                                It is 'technical' in that it relates to a detailed understanding of what a method is. And for that, of course, it takes time to absorb in detail.
                                However, if any of the framework requires additional (undocumented within the framework) knowledge in order to understand what the framework means, then this is a failure.
                                I am not a composer, method designer, and not a very experienced conductor, but I am perfectly capable of understanding what these mean and their significance to the Exercise.
                                And perhaps one day I might become one of these things, so making it accessible (which on the whole you have succeeded at) would help that to happen.
                                You should also stop portraying this work as 'of interest to only a few ringers'. This is only partly true.
                                Most ringers assume they are not interested because they are continually told it is not interesting.
                                But every ringer understands that a method name consists of a title, a classification and a stage.
                                This is part of the framework and is built into how we teach people about ringing.
                                OK, the very finest detail is more esoteric, but then so are certain aspects of ringing history, or bellframe construction, or safeguarding issues,
                                none of which we portray as too difficult for the ordinary ringer to understand.</i>

                                We decided for this first version of the framework only to make a general
                                exhortation on good striking (see the definition of Performance - 3.K.1).
                                We've also included a general ringing quality criterion to the role of
                                umpire(s) in record lengths -- see 7.B.5.
                                We've put adding more detail on handstroke gaps, cartwheeling, bell spacing and similar
                                on the list for consideration for a subsequent version of the framework.

                                <i>I could follow most of [Section 13 -- Method Extension Processes] (the diagrams are helpful),
                                but I didn't understand just what a 'mode' was and what it was supposed to mean.
                                It also wasn't clear that the example was Mode=2 from the supplied diagrams.
                                What is the significance of Mode=2, and how is is different from Mode=1 or Mode=6?
                                I understood that Mode has a number between 1 and the Stage (so 6 in this example),
                                but I don't understand what the significance of the selection is.
                                This seems important for the remainder of the criteria and how each section is defined.</i>

                                We've added some additional explanation of mode in Section 13, which hopefully clears this up [to be added].
                                Here's a standalone example:
                                Assume a Treble Dodging Major method has place notation below the treble of x12x 3 for sections F G.
                                (F = treble in 5-6; G = treble in 6-7.)
                                When creating sections E2 F2 for the Royal extension (E2 = treble in 7-8; F2 = treble in 8-9), if the mode was 1, E2 F2 would be x14x 5.
                                This is because mode 1 means any place made in 1st's place or below remains the same in the extension, and any place
                                made in 2nd's place or higher moves up 2 places.
                                So the 1 in 12 is unchanged, but the 2 in 12 moves up to 4, and the 3 moves up to 5.
                                If the mode was 2, E2 F2 would be x12x 5, because mode 2 means any place made in 2nd's place or below remains the same in the extension, and any place
                                made in 3rd's place or higher moves up 2 places.
                                Similarly, if the mode was 3 or higher, E2 F2 would be x12x 3 (i.e. the same as E F).

                                Is it possible to name a method on 12 and it therefore becomes the Parent which then potentially
                                precludes the use of the same name for lower numbers, given the current definition?</i>

                                Giving a new lower stage method the same name as an existing higher stage method isn't precluded
                                provided the methods are related.
                                E.g. assume XYZ Maximus has been rung and named.
                                If a Major method is rung, and an extension process can be applied to the Major method
                                to obtain XYZ Maximus, then the Major and Maximus methods are related.
                                The Major method can therefore be named XYZ Major if all other extension requirements are met.
                                The term "parent" doesn't imply that the parent method was rung and named before any extensions
                                were rung / named.  Parent is just the lower or lowest stage method in a set of related methods.

                                While we agree "report of the umpire(s)" better handles both singular and plural
                                instances, we felt that "umpires' report" is part of the record length vernacular.

                                Yes. We've now expanded 7.B.5 to include, in general terms, the type of checking the umpire(s) should do.
                                Also, 6.C.2.g states the norm that "No person not ringing provided any assistance in the execution of the ringing during the Performance, e.g. making calls, detecting or correcting errors."
                                This replaces the "No assistance of any kind" language of the Decisions.
                                This means that if an umpire (or any other person present), say, picks up a ringer's water bottle that has fallen out of the ringer's reach,
                                this is acceptable as it isn't assistance with the execution of the ringing.
                                The same would apply to turning on a light, turning off a heater, etc.

                                This might be the single most contentious issue that has emerged during the framework project,
                                so here's a longer answer covering this point.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Clearly there's a strong link between the word 'peal' and the ringing of an extent of Triples,
                                and in fact in the early days of ringing, peal was also used to describe the ringing of an extent of Minor.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It might have been more elegant if peals at all stages had originally been defined as 5040 or more changes.
                                But peals of less than 5040 started to be rung for Major and above as early as 1755,
                                and so the 5000 minimum for higher stages is long established, and dates to well before the Central Council was formed.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                While many people would like to see 5040 retained as the minimum length for a peal of Triples,
                                there are many others who support peals having a minimum length of 5000 changes at all stages.
                                The limited data we have suggests a split of around 60/40 on this difficult question.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It’s perhaps also worth noting that the length of the extent isn't part of ringing’s performance terminology anywhere else.
                                For example, a QP of Minor is reasonably close to two extents, but there wasn’t a move to make 1440 the minimum number of changes for a Minor QP.
                                This isn’t a directly comparable situation given that we all recognize that the concept of a peal originated from the goal of ringing an extent of Triples.
                                But it highlights that we can view standard performance boundaries (1250, 2500, 5000, 10000) as distinct from extent lengths (24, 120, 720, 5040).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Setting the definition as 5000 for all stages allows those who want to continue ringing no less than 5040 to do so.
                                But setting the definition at 5040 takes away the option of ringing between 5000 and 5039 from those who want it.
                                Using 5000 is therefore the permissive option.  It’s clearly also the simpler option, as a peal can have the same definition across all stages.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There could be a separate carve-out for Triples – i.e. for all stages except Triples, a peal requires a minimum of 5000 changes,
                                but for Triples the minimum is 5040.
                                But this then raises several other questions: should a QP of Triples (the length that enables a new method to be named) be 1260 instead of 1250?
                                Is a half peal of Triples 2520 and a long length of Triples 10080?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There could be valid reasons for wanting to ring 5000-5039 Triples.  There might be a wish to ring a peal in this length
                                for an anniversary of the last two numbers (e.g. a 5026 for a 26th birthday) and only a Triples band is available.
                                There could be an interesting compositional reason for doing so -- e.g. there's a true, non-round 5039 of Grandsire Triples
                                that only uses bobs.
                                For over two centuries, composers have been searching for a bobs-only extent of Erin Triples.  So far, the longest
                                true bobs-only touch found is [4940] changes.  If, say, a 5004 is found (before any longer length),
                                a number of ringers would be interested in ringing it.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                Even with a move to a standard minimum peal length of 5000, we can be sure that the vast majority of Triples peals will continue to be 5040 changes in length.
                                There is, of course, something very elegant and appealing about ringing every possible row exactly once.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In 2014, the Decisions were relaxed to allow peals of Triples to include partial extents.
                                Previously a peal of Triples could only be whole multiples of extents (5040, 10080, 15120, etc).
                                Under the current Decisions, they can be any length that is 5040 or higher.
                                Since that update, 317 peals of Triples have been posted on BellBoard.
                                Only one of them took advantage of the Decision change -- a 5320 of Grandsire Triples.
                                This was an interesting performance because the composition was bobs only -- not something that can be done in a 5040 of Grandsire Triples.
                                We have similar expectations that ringers will only choose to ring between 5000 and 5039 of Triples when there is a specific reason for doing so.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We’ve therefore retained 5000 as the minimum length for peals across all stages.
                                This is the permissive approach, and keeping ringing terminology as simple and consistent as possible makes things easier for new ringers joining the Exercise.
                                No one has to ring a 5000 – 5039 of Triples if they don’t want to, but equally we don't think anyone should try to prevent those who do want to ring a 5000 – 5039 of Triples from claiming a peal,
                                given this number meets the requirement for a peal at other stages.
                                In any community such as ours there will be a wide range of opionions, and ultimately it's beneficial if we can find ways to coexist as peacefully as possible.
                                No one thinks a 4992 should be a peal (ok, you could probably find someone who thinks this), but there are many ringers who would like to see 5000 as the minimum peal length across all stages.
                                The 5040 supporters can still choose never to ring peals of Triples of less than 5040.

                                The 'process' part is a little tricky and leaves scope for well defined, but useless definitions.<br />

                                This exists, but we don't know what it is.<br />
                                It is a 'static method'.<br />
