                                No. The reason this isn't needed is because alternative B always classifies a hunter based on the path of the treble, regardless of how many hunt bells there are. This is viewed as aligning more closely with the historic terms used -- treble bob, treble dodging, treble place.

                                that introduced differential hunters.

                                Hunting as a standalone term is intended to refer to progressing through the places at a rate of one place per row.
                                This is distinct from a Plain Path, which comprises hunting up, making a place, hunting down and making another place.

                                Change ringing can be viewed as having two separate branches: method ringing and call change ringing.
                                (The term 'call changes' is probably a simplification of what originally may have been 'called changes'.)
                                When looking at how the framework (and previously the Decisions) supports method ringing,
                                one finds that call change ringing doesn't require the same support.
                                There's no central library of call change callings, no tradition of publishing call change performances,
                                or ringing record lengths of call changes, and no practice of classifying call changes
                                or extending sets of call changes to give related sets at higher stages.
                                While there's no reason why the above couldn't develop, it hasn't thus far.

                            <p>
                                For the reasons above, and also so we can keep our focus on implementing the framework for method ringing sooner rather than later,
                                we therefore don't propose to include a description of call change ringing in the framework at this stage.
                                However, there may be a case for adding this in a subsequent version of the framework if the
                                ringing community thinks this would be useful.

                                round block (5.D.4). If methods false in the plain course are permitted, why can't a variation that cannot produce
                                a true 120? Considering the rest of the framework, this seems somewhat prescriptive. There are Doubles variations
                                that have been rung and named already for which a 120 is not possible, but a 240 can be rung (e.g. Heterodox Doubles:

                                We recognize that jump changes is a divisive topic, and some ringers don't consider them to be part of method ringing.
                                In line with our descriptive / permissive mandate, we've included jump changes in the framework.
                                But to enable ringers who object to jump changes to be able to ignore any reported performances that include them,
                                we felt disclosure was needed.  Note that since methods that include jump changes will have 'Jump' in their method
                                titles, disclosure is only required when jump calls are used with non-jump methods
                                (see the further explanation of Section 6.C.2).

                                <i>I would urge the proponents of these changes to tread very carefully indeed.
                                History shows that when traditional and ingrained systems are swept away, those who are not prepared to put up with it
                                will break away from the existing structures and form their own traditional groups.
                                Anglicanism is a good example where there are now thousands of traditionalists broken away from Lambeth throughout the world.
                                An alternative Council of Traditional English Change Ringers would be a disaster for the art given the challenges to ringing
                                posed by on-going collapse of the Church of England.</i>

                                The Decisions have been a source of controversy since the formation of the Council, and many believe
                                the Decisions' approach of ruling out ringing that hasn't been done before has harmed the Council's reputation,
                                especially among more advanced ringers. The motion to switch to a descriptive / permissive approach
                                passed with a very clear majority at the Edinburgh CC meeting.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However we recognize that traditionalists won't like all the forms of method ringing that the framework describes.
                                The framework uses a disclosure approach so that performances that differed from method ringing norms
                                can be identified as such.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There is also, deliberately, nothing in the framework that prevents a group of traditionalist ringers
                                from forming a Society (which can become affiliated with the Central Council) that implements additional
                                restrictions on what is considers methods or peals.
                                For example, this Society might choose to only recognize peals of Triples and below that are rung
                                in whole extents, and that only include methods that are principles or have Plain Bob leadheads / leadends.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Ultimately ringers with a wide range of opinions have to find ways to coexist with one another,
                                and we believe that a descriptive / permissive approach, paired with disclosure and the ability
                                of like-minded ringers to form societies that focus on the types of ringing they're interested in,
                                is the most likely way to achieve this.

                                The are various overlapping terms in method ringing (e.g. touch and composition),
                                as well as the same term having more than one meaning (e.g. lead can refer to ringing in 1st's place or a lead of a method).
                                We've tried to distinguish these as well as possible.
                                When talking about a method, we are only referring to a sequence of changes.  When referring to a block,
                                the method is applied to a starting row to obtain a set of rows.  A block is therefore a specific application of a method.
                                Similarly a composition is only a set of changes.  When applied to a starting row a touch is produced, which is a specific application
                                of a composition.  [To be completed / refined]

                                find difficult to understand, so perhaps a glossary of terms might be given somewhere.
                                Reports of peals in the RW now refer to cyclical and particles and it would be helpful to the rank and file ringers

                                A very important aspect of the new framework is that we are not seeking to allow or disallow certain
                                types of ringing.
                                Instead we are seeking to provide a common terminology that enables ringers
                                to describe what they rang, such that other ringers can read about ringing performances
                                and be clear on what was rung.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Whole pull ringing doesn't follow the norms of method ringing.
                                Under Section 6.C n) the report of a whole pull performance should therefore include a disclosure that the composition was rung in whole pulls.
                                As noted above, whole pull ringing can work well when the bells are half-muffled.

                                The framework team agrees. The first version of the framework won't be perfect,
                                and it's doubtful there could ever be a perfect framework.
                                We envisage a process of continous imrprovement to the framework over time
                                as issues and inconsistencies are discovered, and as method ringing continues to evolve.

                                We've changed 7.C.4 to refer to umpire(s)’ report, consistent with 9.D.5.
                                While we agree "report of the umpire(s)" better handles both singular and plural
                                instances, we felt that "umpires' report" is part of the record length vernacular.

                                <i>I could follow most of [Section 13 -- Method Extension Processes] (the diagrams are helpful),
                                but I didn't understand just what a 'mode' was and what it was supposed to mean.
                                It also wasn't clear that the example was Mode=2 from the supplied diagrams.
                                What is the significance of Mode=2, and how is is different from Mode=1 or Mode=6?
                                I understood that Mode has a number between 1 and the Stage (so 6 in this example),
                                but I don't understand what the significance of the selection is.
                                This seems important for the remainder of the criteria and how each section is defined.</i>

                                We've added some additional explanation of mode in Section 13, which hopefully clears this up [to be added].
                                Here's a standalone example:
                                Assume a Treble Dodging Major method has place notation below the treble of x12x 3 for sections F G.
                                (F = treble in 5-6; G = treble in 6-7.)
                                When creating sections E2 F2 for the Royal extension (E2 = treble in 7-8; F2 = treble in 8-9), if the mode was 1, E2 F2 would be x14x 5.
                                This is because mode 1 means any place made in 1st's place or below remains the same in the extension, and any place
                                made in 2nd's place or higher moves up 2 places.
                                So the 1 in 12 is unchanged, but the 2 in 12 moves up to 4, and the 3 moves up to 5.
                                If the mode was 2, E2 F2 would be x12x 5, because mode 2 means any place made in 2nd's place or below remains the same in the extension, and any place
                                made in 3rd's place or higher moves up 2 places.
                                Similarly, if the mode was 3 or higher, E2 F2 would be x12x 3 (i.e. the same as E F).

                                Is it possible to name a method on 12 and it therefore becomes the Parent which then potentially
                                precludes the use of the same name for lower numbers, given the current definition?</i>

                                Giving a new lower stage method the same name as an existing higher stage method isn't precluded
                                provided the methods are related.
                                E.g. assume XYZ Maximus has been rung and named.
                                If a Major method is rung, and an extension process can be applied to the Major method
                                to obtain XYZ Maximus, then the Major and Maximus methods are related.
                                The Major method can therefore be named XYZ Major if all other extension requirements are met.
                                The term "parent" doesn't imply that the parent method was rung and named before any extensions
                                were rung / named.  Parent is just the lower or lowest stage method in a set of related methods.
