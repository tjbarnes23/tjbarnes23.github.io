                                Handling of additional hunt bells isn't needed in Alternative B because this alternative always classifies a hunter based on the path of the treble bell, regardless of how many hunt bells there are. This is viewed as aligning more closely with the historic terms used -- e.g. treble bob, treble dodging and treble place.
                                However this is now a moot point as the classification system we've moved to (which can be viewed as somewhere between Alternatives A and B) applies the hierarchical approach to hunt paths that is used in Alternative A.

                                As noted in our Oct 26th 2018 RW article (see Appendix G.7),
                                we've now settled on a classification system that can be viewed as falling somewhere between Alt A and
                                Alt B, and is the single classification section now included in this website.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However, we do plan to put together a table that compares the classifications used in the Decisions,
                                Alt A, Alt B, and the final classification system used in the framework.
                                We'll update this FAQ with a link to the classification comparison table when ready.

                                The term 'hunter' is fairly recent - it was introduced in 2002 as part of the update to the Decisions
                                that introduced differential hunters.
                                We debated whether to use 'hunt method' instead of 'hunter', and possibly also 'differential method'
                                instead of 'differential'.  But the one-word versions are useful (e.g. when wanting conciseness on a web page)
                                so the consensus was to keep 'hunter' and 'differential'.
                                But we drew the line at 'jumper', given its other meanings.

                                We intend Hunting, as a standalone term, to mean hunting in a single direction (i.e. either hunting up or hunting down).
                                The main use of hunting is in the definition of a Place method, in which the paths of all the bells consist only of Hunting and Making Places.

                                This is distinct from a Plain Hunt Path (or Plain Hunting Path), which consists of hunting up, making a place, hunting down and making another place.
                                While Plain Hunt Path isn't a term we needed to define for use elsewhere,
                                we've now included this term in the further explanation of the Plain Method class definition (see Section 4.D.1).

                                The framework does define the ringing terms it uses as they are introduced.
                                However, we've only defined the terms that are needed across the framework.
                                We don't view the framework as the right place to house an extensive glossary of ringing terms --
                                this would turn an already-complex document into an even more complex one.
                                However an extensive glossary of ringing terms already exists <a href="http://jaharrison.me.uk/Ringing/Glossary">here</a>.

                                Words have been capitalised in the framework where they are specialist ringing terms that are defined elsewhere in the framework.
                                This was previously noted in Section 2, which has become Appendix E, so we've now added this note to Section 1 to make it more prominent.
                                A better approach might be to italicise the words rather than capitalise them,
                                and make them hyperlinks to the definitions in question (which also gives the option of presenting them underlined or in a different color).
                                There is various scope overall for improving the appearance of the framework website -- this is on the list of items to consider
                                for a subsequent version of the framework, including how best to highlight defined terms.

                                Identity was chosen because it's used in mathematics to denote an operation that, when applied to an input, produces an output that is the same as the input.
                                E.g. the identity for addition is zero, because n + 0 = n.  In change ringing, we apply a change to a row in order to produce a new row, so it's
                                consistent to call the change that results in a new row that's the same as the previous row the identity change.
                                'Null change' has also been used in the past for the identity change.  A discussion about this in the ringing-theory email group indicated a preference for identity over null.

                                Agreed. To give a better structure to the framework, we've now moved the former Section 2 to Appendix E (Framework Development).
                                This also solves the ordering issue that you raise.

                                The are various terms in method ringing that have similar meanings (e.g. touch and composition),
                                as well as terms that have more than one meaning (e.g. lead can refer to ringing in 1st's place or a lead of a method).
                                We've tried to distinguish similar terms as best we can:
                                We view a method as just the sequence of changes, without considering the rows that the method can be used to generate.<br />
                                A block, on the other hand, results from applying a sequence of changes (i.e. a method or a composition) to a starting row (normally rounds).
                                A block therefore comprises a set of rows and the changes used to generate them.<br />
                                A method can be viewed as the process, and a block as the result of the process.<br />
                                Related to these terms, a touch is a block generated by a composition,
                                and a plain lead and a plain course are blocks generated by a single method without any calls.

                                Also, the framework exists to be able to describe all method ringing and is not intended as an introductory primer to method ringing --
                                there are other publications that provide this.

                                Although not an introductory primer, it should be accessible to as many ringers as possible.
                                However, we are considering adding a new section to a subsequent version of the framework that describes method ringing in mathematical terms
                                (with development of this led by a ringing mathematician).
                                This could then by used by mathematicians -- e.g. to reference in an academic paper.

                                <i>I was unclear about the use of stage at various points in the framework.
                                There seem to be requirements of various terms to be all 'of the same stage' which did not make sense to my mind as it
                                precluded blocks/compositions of spliced triples and major (given the commonplace understanding of the term 'stage').
                                However, an explanation is found hidden away in explanatory notes for cover bells.
                                I think that something should be done to enable a clearer understanding of this concept in the main text,
                                especially as various sections of the explanatory notes relate; not everything is one place.
                                (I also do not understand why Plain Bob Doubles/Plain Bob Minor rung side by side on 12 produces Maximus changes
                                as there are 11 bells affected by the method – so surely this would be cinques changes
                                as per the example given elsewhere of Plain Bob Minor/Plain Bob Cinques rung side by side).</i>

                                A few people commented that the use of 'stage' in the framework wasn't clear,
                                and/or that the information on 'stage' is too fragmented across the framework.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Because stage is a concept that applies to various other concepts (rows, changes, blocks,
                                methods and compositions), organising the information can become circular
                                (e.g. the definition of method involves stage, but defining stage without referring to a method
                                can be too abstract).
                                To address this, we've created a short document that covers all aspects of stage
                                in one place.
                                The framework now links to this document wherever stage is defined,
                                i.e. in the definition of Row (3.B.1), Change (3.C.1), Block (3.D.1), Method (3.E.1), Composition (3.G.1)
                                and Cover Bell (3.H.1), as well as in the initial definition of Stage itself (3.A.1).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                On the question about Doubles / Minor rung side by side on 12 bells,
                                this would indeed normally result in Cinques changes, which could then be 
                                rung (say) with the 12th as a cover bell.
                                But in the example in the technical comment of 3.H.1, the Doubles is being rung
                                on bells 1-5, and the Minor is being ruing on bells 7-12, with 6th's place containing
                                a cover bell.
                                For practical purposes (e.g. when entering changes into a proving program),
                                the changes would most likely be specificed as Maximus changes, with a place notation of '6'
                                included in every change.
                                But the effective stage of the block produced by these changes would still be Cinques (assuming there are no other
                                fixed places).

                                I wondered if it should be the 1st row as if you start a touch in rounds, the first change takes you to the first non-rounds touch of the composition;
                                therefore is the initial row really part of the composition?
                                There are probably good reasons, however, why this is not the case which I have not appreciated.</i>

                                We had quite a lengthy debate on this point when drafting the framework.
                                The reality is that when determining the truth of a round block, you can exclude 
                                either the initial row or the final row (these two rows being the same).
                                We felt that using either/or language throughout the framework would be a little cumbersome,
                                so decided to standardise on including the initial row and excluding the final row.
                                This approach often aligns with the symmetry of what is being rung,
                                and also, in spliced compositions, the atw (all-the-work) property is determined
                                based on a lead starting with the leadhead and finishing with the leadend,
                                rather than one row later (this avoids possible missed rows due to calls).
                                But in practice the other approach will also be useful.
                                E.g. when judging a striking competition, if the rules call for not judging the opening
                                and closing rounds, the judge probably won't know the touch has started until she hears
                                a non-rounds row.
                                So in this scenario, it would make sense to exclude the initial row
                                and include the final row for judging purposes.

                                Yes, 'same set of methods' is referring to multi-method performances (which are often, but not always, spliced).
                                A method is always defined at the level of its method title.
                                For example, Cambridge Surprise Minor and Cambridge Surprise Major are not the same method --
                                they are two different methods that are related (via a method extension process).
                                Similarly Yorkshire Surprise Major and Yorkshire Delight Major
                                are also two different methods -- ones that happen to share the same method name.
                                We've amended 9.B.1 to clarify the above, and have also added that
                                variations can also be used to generate a unique set of methods / variations with which to ring
                                a record length.

                                A good point, and one that generated some debate among the framework team.
                                We ended up thinking that a little path doesn't need to be confined to hunt bells, though we agree that's the most common usage.
                                We've now added a paragraph to the further explanation of 4.A.6 clarifying this.

                                Method Class is in fact defined -- see 4.A.1.
                                We didn't think that Method Class Descriptor needed a separate, formal definition because
                                the dictionary definition of Descriptor applies.
                                We therefore went straight to defining how Method Class Desciptors are formed (5.B.1).
                                As a general rule for the framework, we haven't defined terms where the normal dictionary definition of the word suffices.

                                We were thinking here of handbell performances where each ringer only rings one bell.
                                While these are rung infrequently, we wanted the framework to be able to accurately
                                describe them if they are rung.
                                BellBoard today has one form for one-bell-per-ringer, and another form for two-bells-per-ringer.
                                A one-bell-per-ringer handbell performance could therefore look like a tower bell performance,
                                so 6.B.1 e) gives a requirement to footnote that such a performance was on handbells.
                                We've now edited 6.B.1 to include this point.
                                The same issue might apply to a tower bell performance where each ringer rang two bells.
                                But this would likely be posted on BellBoard with the name of each ringer entered twice against two bells,
                                so the report would be clear as to what was rung.

                                We've now updated 6.A to cover this, but made it optional as to where the number of methods is put,

                                Agreed. We've now added a definition of variable cover as part of 3.H (Cover Bells).
                                Like spliced, variable cover is an attribute of a composition, so we've also now stated
                                that a performance title includes 'variable cover' if the performance included ringing a variable cover composition.

                                <i>Although the meaning is clear at all times in your text, I feel that there is a potential for misunderstanding in the use of the word 'extent'.
                                It is commonly used to mean (eg on 5) 'all 120 possible changes rung consecutively'.
                                Thus 'call two extents of Grandsire Doubles' would widely be interpreted to mean calling a 120 then another 120 immediately following,
                                while a 240 that has each row once at hand and once at back would more often be called a 'double-extent'.
                                But in your usage this 240 could be called 'two extents' as each change occurs twice, but the two extents are intertwined.
                                You seem to anticipate this possible confusion by adding the clarifying remark 'The location of individual Rows within a Block of Rows does not have any bearing on truth.'
                                Good - but I feel there is still a need to point out these two different possible interpretations of the word 'extent' - or maybe have two different words???

                                We agree ringing hasn't evolved clear terminology to differentiate between a round block comprising two extents
                                (where the rows can appear in any order), and two individual extents rung consecutively.
                                Where terminology like this hasn't evolved, it usually means that either the distinction often isn't important,
                                or the distinction can be made using ordinary dictionary words (such as 'two individual extents rung consecutively'
                                as above.)
                                We've now updated 3.J.1 to point out the possibly ambiguity, and noted that care should be taken with communication
                                where this distinction is important.

                                Yes, blocks are introduced early (3.D) but this is deliberate. We tried many different ways of organising
                                the information to minimise the number of forward references needed, and give the most intuitive
                                groupings of terms, and we found that introducing blocks before methods, calls, compositions and cover bells gave the
                                best results.

                                The count of changes is the same regardless of whether the block is round or not.
                                But when determining truth (which is a function of rows), the final row of a non-round block is included in the test,
                                whereas for a round block it's excluded.

                                We're now reordered the framework so that the references to truth and accepted truth that were in 2.B.6 are now in Appendix E
                                (Framework Development). This gives a better ordering of the information.

                                There can be many different ways to apply truth (e.g. in a 240 of Doubles, each row appearing once at handstroke
                                and once at backstroke might be considered 'more true' than a 240 where each row simply appears twice).
                                In the interests of simplicity, we felt it would be valuable to have a single definition of truth that applies
                                to all stages and all lengths, hence the definition used in 3.J.4.
                                While 'complete' is a reasonably-well-known term for describing a block that contains each possible row at least once,
                                we found we didn't need 'complete' to define any other term or requirement in the framework, so in the
                                interests of simplicity, we didn't include 'complete' as a defined term.

                                Yes, both the changes and the rows.  A block results from applying a given sequence of changes to an intial row.
                                While in practice, most ringing uses rounds as the initial row, a different block could be obtained
                                from the same sequence of changes by using a different initial row.  The two blocks' changes would be the same,
                                but their rows would be different.

                                But because it would be cumbersome to use 'methods / variations' or similar in multiple places in the framework,
                                we just used 'methods', and 5.D.5 then serves to expand the other references to also include variations.

                                (and less if there are opening or closing rounds), so not a peal length.
                                Length is always the number of changes, not the number of rows (see 3.I.2),
                                and the number of changes is not affected by whether or not the rows are a round block.

                                We retained Octuples (stage 17) primarily because a peal of Octuples has been rung
                                (this is the highest odd-stage peal rung to date).
                                We didn't think nonuples was in the ringers' lexicon to the extent its

                                The problem with the suggested definition is that 'each bell' is undefined.
                                E.g. does it mean 'each bell in the tower' or even (to make a point) 'each bell in England'?
                                The defining feature of a row is that no bell appears more than once,
                                regardless of which bells do appear.
                                When rows are combined into blocks, there is then an additional
                                constraint that every row in the block comprises the same set of bells.
                                This follows from the definition of change as a transposition.
                                We've now added to the further explanations of 3.C.1 and 3.D.1 to clarify this point.

                                Agreed on looking messy. In practice, we don't expect identity and jump changes to be rung
                                frequently, so in normal usage 'adjacent change' will be abbreviated to just 'change'
                                and the meaning will be clear from the context.

                                is thought to aid ringers in communicating about method ringing.

                                and many different calls can be used with a single method.
                                However, when reporting the number of changes rung of a given method in a performance,
                                the count includes those changes that were modifications to the method's changes resulting from calls.

                                Ringing a 18 change as the leadend change in Cambridge S Major is an example of the well-known problem of overlap in describing method ringing.
                                The same set of changes can be described in many different ways, and there's no satisfactory way of eliminating
                                this overlap.
                                Ringers therefore use their judgement in deciding which is the most appropriate way to describe a given set of changes.
                                A 18 leadend change in Cambridge could be described as a composition of spliced Cambridge and Primrose,
                                or the 18 change could be described as an additional call in a Cambridge composition.

                                Note that reporting 1440 changes would give a more expected alignment with the reported time of the performance.
                                Also note that at higher stages, whole pull ringing would almost certainly be false, leading to a disclosure

                                <i>"Technical comments: As discussed above under Compositions (Section 3.G),
                                it is possible for a Composition to use two or more Methods side by side,
                                or to use two or more Compositions side by side.
                                As a further variation, a Composition might also result in an interior Cover Bell.
                                For example, a Composition might be designed to be used with Maximus Rows,
                                using a Doubles Method in Places 1 to 5 and a Minor Method in Places 7 to 12.
                                6th's Place does not have any Methods operating on it, and therefore 6th's Place contains a Cover Bell.
                                In this case, the Composition would produce Maximus Changes (and therefore have a Stage of Maximus),
                                and each of its Changes would include the place notation '6'."<br />
                                I read that as being an Effective Stage of Cinques.<br />
                                I guess with fixed bells in the middle you could use jump changes to swap bells from the front to the back.</i>

                                Yes to both. The effective stage is Cinques (even though the composition has a stage of Maximus),
                                and jump changes could be used to jump between, say, 5th's place and 7th's place, thereby
                                leaving 6th's place as an interior cover bell.

                                On your first point, 'row' and 'change' have indeed been used interchangeably over the years to refer to what the framework describes as a 'row'.
                                In the earliest ringing publications the term 'change' was used to cover both the process of moving the bells and the resulting sequence.
                                However, by the late 1800s, technical writers needed to split the process from the result, and these terms became 'row' and 'change'.
                                E.g. from 'A Note on Grandsire Triples', W.H. Thompson, Macmillan and Bowes, 1886, page 7: 'Any one permutation of the 7 bells is called a 'row'.
                                The Decisions have been making the distinction between a row and change since at least 1970.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As with many terms, this distinction has not been made consistently, either in common parlance or ringing literature.
                                To address this, we've added the following to Section 3.B.1:<br />
                                'Note that what is defined as a Row in this section is sometimes described as a Change in common ringing parlance,
                                and this usage of Change will be found in some method ringing books and articles.
                                The framework separately uses Change as the transition between two Rows (see Section 3.C) and this distinction between Row and Change
                                is important in defining a number of other method ringing terms used in the framework.
                                Row is the preferred term wherever possible.'
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We do need a term for the transition between rows because these are the building blocks for methods and compositions.
                                E.g. Plain Bob Minor comprises the changes x16x16x16x16x16x12 -- here it's clear that changes are referring to transitions,
                                and not to an order of bells.
                                In a composition, a bob might replace a 12 change with a 14 change, and so on.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                On your second point, stage does refer to Doubles, Major, etc. It's an established term -- e.g. used in the Decisions since at least 1970.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Finally, principles do have leads in the same way as any other method. We often don't think of them this way,
                                probably because the most well-known principle (Stedman) lends itself to being thought of in sixes,
                                where we don't even normally start and finish at a six-end.
                                But the same lead structure is there (Stedman has 12 changes in a lead),
                                and if you look at other principles (e.g. Double Éire Minor) the lead structure is more apparent.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Not considering principles to have leads is also partly historic. Principles used not to be considered methods, and were said to be made up of divisions rather than leads. But the Decisions have considered principles to be methods since at least 1970.
                                Between 1970 and 1999 the Decisions referred to principles being made up of divisions or leads.  In 1999, division was dropped.
                                Consequently the framework drafting team have seen no reason to retain the term division when lead is sufficient,
                                and using one term for all methods is simpler.

                                round block (5.D.4). If methods false in the plain course are permitted, why can't a variation that cannot produce
                                a true 120? Considering the rest of the framework, this seems somewhat prescriptive. There are Doubles variations
                                that have been rung and named already for which a 120 is not possible, but a 240 can be rung (e.g. Heterodox Doubles:

                                In line with our descriptive / permissive mandate, we've included jump changes in the framework
                                so that if they're rung, there is terminology to describe them.
                                But since jump changes have not been the norm in method ringing,
                                we want their use to be clear in performance reports.
                                Since methods that include jump changes will have 'Jump' in their method
                                titles, additional disclosure is therefore only needed when (a) jump calls are used with non-jump methods,
                                and (b) variations with jump changes are used (variations don't use class descriptors
                                in their titles).

                                <i>I would urge the proponents of these changes to tread very carefully indeed.
                                History shows that when traditional and ingrained systems are swept away, those who are not prepared to put up with it
                                will break away from the existing structures and form their own traditional groups.
                                Anglicanism is a good example where there are now thousands of traditionalists broken away from Lambeth throughout the world.
                                An alternative Council of Traditional English Change Ringers would be a disaster for the art given the challenges to ringing
                                posed by on-going collapse of the Church of England.</i>

                                The Decisions have been a source of controversy since the formation of the Council, and many believe
                                the Decisions' approach of ruling out ringing that hasn't been done before has harmed the Council's reputation,
                                especially among more advanced ringers. The motion to switch to a descriptive / permissive approach
                                passed with a very clear majority at the Edinburgh CC meeting.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However we recognise that traditionalists won't like all the forms of method ringing that the framework describes.
                                The framework uses a disclosure approach so that performances that differ from method ringing norms
                                can be identified as such.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There is also, deliberately, nothing in the framework that prevents a group of traditionalist ringers
                                from forming a society (which could become affiliated with the Central Council) that implements additional
                                restrictions on what it considers methods or peals.
                                For example, this society might choose only to recognise peals of Triples and below that are rung
                                in whole extents, and only that involve methods that are principles or are hunters with Plain Bob or Grandsire leadheads / leadends.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Ultimately ringers with a wide range of opinions have to find ways to coexist with one another,
                                and we believe that a descriptive / permissive approach, paired with disclosure and the ability
                                of like-minded ringers to group together to focus on the types of ringing they're interested in,
                                is the most likely way to achieve this.

                                <i>I think that what we should strive to avoid is offending against first principles of change ringing that have been established for centuries.
                                Thus I cannot support the introduction of jump changes and multiple covering bells in peals.
                                The peal is a benchmark of achievement and there is no case for allowing people who can barely handle a bell in Rounds
                                to follow another bell for three hours in the pretense that they are now a peal ringer.
                                Extra covering bells have a place in Quarters to give rope-time to learners, but not in peal ringing.
                                If this is permitted we will soon see a peal of Minimus rung on 12 with 8 covering bells which would bring our art into disrepute.</i>

                                That is a nonsense. However what I do want to see, and have advocated for many years is the acceptance of Singles.
                                I do not see a case for saying that a band who have worked away at a probably rough 3 for nearly three hours have not rung a Peal.
                                Singles should be the basic minimum stage for change ringing.</i>

                                Much Central Council time was taken up debating whether 4-bell peals should be recognised.
                                We could clearly spend more time debating whether 3-bell peals should be recognised, and then 2-bell peals.
                                Similarly, we could spend much time in the future debating whether jump changes and multiple cover bells should be recognised.
                                With the CRAG mandate, the Council has decided this is not a good approach.
                                The mandate was very clear -- the aim of the framework is to be permissive and describe what ringers choose to ring,
                                rather than specifying rules over what the Council will and will not recognise.
                                This is a direct response by the Council to the recognition that the previous system hasn't worked well,
                                has caused much controversy, and has harmed the Council's reputation, obscuring much of its other good work.
                                It's now time to try something new -- namely to provide standard terminology for ringers to describe what they rang,
                                and leave it to them to decide what they want to ring.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The aim of trying to use the framework to enforce ringing standards (i.e. quality) is also misguided in our view.
                                Standards vary widely by band and location, and a one-size-fits-all central approach will inevitably
                                result in the bar being set too high for some and too low for others.
                                Encouraging improved ringing quality is better addressed at the local level,
                                with the Central Council possibly providing guidance / tips, and/or promoting training events and similar.

                                This is the question of whether the identity change should be recognised.
                                For example, an extent of Plain Bob Doubles can be turned into a true 240 by calling a
                                single with place notation 12345 at two points 120 changes apart.
                                This 240 has the nice feature of every row appearing once at handstroke and once at backstroke.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Since a 12345 change results in every bell staying in the same place from one row to the next,
                                it is the identity change for Doubles.
                                Given there are valid uses of identity changes, as shown in the example above, and that
                                our mandate is to be permissive and decriptive, we believe identity
                                changes should be covered in the framework.  It is then up to individual
                                ringers and bands to decide whether they want to make use of them.

                                This is the mandate we were given, which was decided by a very clear majority vote of the Central Council,
                                and the framework team believes it was the right mandate.
                                However, it's certainly correct that increasing permissiveness does also increase complexity, and there's a limit to how simple
                                you can make a method ringing framework (we've interpreted the mandate as being to make the framework
                                <i>as simple as possible</i>).

                                The framework aims to cover all types of method ringing so it isn't designed as a primer for new ringers,
                                though we've tried to make it accessible to as many ringers as possible.
                                Ringing authors might develop or update guides (e.g. for new / developing ringers) that just cover the parts of the
                                framework that relate to what is more commonly rung.

                                The former is described in the futher explanation of 3.H.1.
                                The latter is an example of the well-known problem of overlap in describing method ringing.
                                You could describe a continuously leading bell in 8-bell rows as a leading cover bell rung with a Triples method,
                                or as a Major method with a stationary bell in 1st's place.
                                A leading cover bell with a Triples method might be the simpler description of what was rung, but if
                                there was also a stationary bell in, say, 5th's place, and both stationary bells were affected by calls,
                                thereby changing the stationary bells, the changes might be better described as a composition of a Major method.
                                Ringers therefore use their judgement to decide how best to describe a given set of changes.

                                The purpose of 6.C (performance norms) is to make ringers aware when performances include features that differ from common practice.
                                It will, of course, be for The Ringing World to decide if and how to make use of this information,
                                but it could indeed potentially be used to let readers filter out certain types of performances that they're not interested in reading about.

                                <i>2.A.1 There is an assumption in this that all ringing can be defined in terms of methods and I believe this to be wrong.
                                The term `method' should have a very specific meaning and what should be described is change ringing which is the general term for what we do.
                                Proposal H did not mention methods.
                                Throughout the framework there is undue mention of methods where it should be change ringing.<br/>
                                The definition of a method seems to be virtually identical to a block.<br />
                                The definitions used are not ones which would be understandable or recognisable to an ordinary ringer.
                                There seems far too much emphasis on mathematical concepts rather than practical ringing.
                                For instance `the identity change' is not a change in the terminology of ringing it is simply a repeated row.
                                I'm afraid this framework does not do what the Council asked for and needs a fundamental reevaluation;
                                the present team and reviewers have too many people from a computing and mathematical background and seem
                                out of touch with practical ringing in the wider world.</i>

                                Many ringers would agree with the idea that a method should have a more limited meaning than just any sequence of changes.
                                The problem is that this falls into the category of "sounds good, doesn't work".
                                In over 100 years of trying, the ringing community hasn't found a limited definition of 'method' that is widely agreed upon.
                                Some of the harshest battles in 20th century ringing related to the definition of a method (e.g. see the book 'Forbidden Methods'
                                where some methods were described as 'illegitimate' or even 'bastards').
                                And see <a href="https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/view.php?id=1100503">here</a> for a more recent dispute over the definition of a method.

                            <p>
                                Progress comes from learning from the past.
                                Since there is no practicable way of limiting the definition of a method without also ruling out sensible cases,
                                the only solution is to enable any sequence of changes to be named as a method.
                                This is what the framework does, and it's also consistent with our permissive / descriptive mandate.
                                We trust that ringers will be sensible in what they choose to name as methods.
                                And if they're not sensible, Section 5.E.3 of the framework contains an anti-abuse provision.

                                On Method vs Block, we've now added additional explanation to 3.E.1 on the difference between these two terms.
                                The distinction is key -- a method is the process (i.e. the changes) and a block is the result of applying the process
                                (i.e. the changes plus the rows produced, given a specified starting row).

                                We recognise the problem of self-selection in a project like this.
                                The sort of people who are interested in becoming politicians are often the last people you want running a country,
                                and the same may be true of people who volunteer to develop a method ringing framework.
                                The only responses we can give are:<br />
                                (1) We've been very conscious of the need to keep things as simple as possible.
                                Many solutions that were more elegant or more purist were ruled out of the framework because we decided they were too complex to include.<br />
                                (2) The framework isn’t intended as a primer on method ringing for people new to the Exercise –
                                there are other publications that capably meet that need.
                                The intended audience for the framework starts at the level of ringers who are already familiar with the basics of method ringing.<br />
                                (3) To be effective, the framework needs to be able to describe all reasonably foreseeable forms of method ringing,
                                not just 'everyday' ringing.  Otherwise it's not a framework -- it's a limited description of some common forms of method ringing.
                                We don't believe that's what the Cental Council intended.  We don't dispute that covering all foreseeable forms of method ringing
                                means there is some complexity to the framework. But we think we've simplified things about as much as is possible,
                                and we deliberately included lots of examples, diagrams and explanations to try and make things as clear as possible.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                At the same time, we're open to any suggestions on how the framework could be simplified.
                                There will be subsequent versions of the framework, which will give the opportunity for new ideas to be considered.

                                <i>I’m not terribly knowledgeable technically, so I have just one comment.
                                I understand that the proposed framework would permit jump changes. If that is so, then I disagree with it for two chief reasons.
                                First, agree with it or not, one of the things that has always distinguished change ringing is its incrementalism.
                                Change ringing patterns have been defined by very few rules, but one of them is that a bell can move only one place in the row.
                                This means that change ringing is a restrictive musical form—but what of that?
                                It simply means that we find enjoyment in working within a narrow musical field—one that
                                shows that great changes can be accomplished incrementally, over time.
                                An analogy in poetry would be to the sonnet. The sonnet is extremely well defined and has been that way for centuries.
                                Why change it? Or at least, if you write a poem in a different structure,
                                why not concede that the result may be a very good poem, but it is not a sonnet?
                                And really, does that matter so much—unless perchance we are counting sonnets that we have recited?
                                Second, I think that moving only one place in a row is a safety consideration.
                                If you encourage methods that include jump changes, then there will be more stays lost, more limbs broken,
                                and more embarrassing press coverage of ringers being lowered out of towers by stretcher, crane, or helicopter.
                                The Church and its insurers will start asking questions.  All this should be avoided.
                                For these reasons I would respectfully suggest that if leading theoreticians want to ring jump changes,
                                then those methods and compositions should simply be among the things that are deemed noncompliant.
                                Nothing prevents people from trying to accomplish them, from celebrating those accomplishments,
                                or from counting them as peals in their personal totals.
                                But jump changes lack official CCCBR imprimatur and so the Exercise can say that they are not typical of what we do.
                                Let’s not break something, only then to find out the very good reasons why it has held its current form for centuries.</i>

                                We agree that incrementalism and working within a restricted space is a key attraction of method ringing.
                                The difficulty, and where your analogy breaks down, is that if someone writes a poem that is not a sonnet,
                                it is still a poem.
                                If we say jump changes are not method ringing, what are they? We don't have a term.
                                And even if we invented a new term, many would object because they consider jump changes
                                to be part of method ringing, and we would be trying to tell them otherwise.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                That's why we introduced the term 'adjacent change' -- to provide a subset term (like sonnet) that enables ringers
                                to describe a piece of ringing that only used traditional changes, should they wish to emphasise this.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We think your safety concerns on jump changes are a little overstated. If you ring at a 4-bell tower, you have to move your bell
                                further for an adjacent change than you do for a 2-place jump when ringing on 10-bells.
                                The risks of jump changes seem far lower than those involved when, say, teaching someone to ring,
                                ringing bells down, or even walking down a narrow or steep tower spiral staircase.
                            </p>                                

                            <p>
                                Furthermore, ringing safety is better addressed at the local level --
                                a one-size-fits-all restriction at the Central Council level isn't appropriate.
                                Some towers have experienced ringers who will have no difficulty executing jump changes.
                                Other towers have beginners who will need close supervision even when ringing adjacent changes.

                                <i>On the subject of jump changes:
                                The new framework has done an excellent job of allowing the flexibility for bands and composers to explore a multitude of constructs and so it
                                would seem to me to be inconsistent for jump changes to be excluded simply because they have not been part of the traditional framework.
                                I do agree that unfettered inclusion could lead to some bizarre results and so the challenge is to provide a little bit of structure
                                and then see what happens.
                                My proposal is to follow the principal that the primary objective is to allow people to describe accurately what they ring.
                                To do this we should start by saying that changes are classified as jump-n. Normal methods are jump-1 (i.e. no bell changes more than one place)
                                but obviously by extension we could define a jump-2 method and so on.
                                It would also be helpful to define whether we have a jump method or are using jump calls.
                                A standard method with jump bobs might be an interesting idea, not everyone's cup of tea but if it allowed better compositions in methods
                                with a lot of falseness it might get some traction.
                                I don't think the reservation that bands might claim a performance by claiming 'Go rounds' is of any concern.
                                At the end of the day we rely on the honesty of bands and conductors to report what was done and not everyone has the same standards with
                                the rules we've got so to say we are not allowing something because we can't trust people to use it responsibly is not the way to go!</i>

                                We agree with all your points. The purpose of the framework is to provide terminology to describe what ringers choose to ring,
                                not to try and impose limits -- that was our permissive / descriptive mandate.
                                Your jump-n notation is a good suggestion -- it would be interesting to see in a performance report involving jump changes
                                what the size of the jumps were.
                                We haven't included this notation in the first version of the framework given that jump changes are rarely rung,
                                but we've tabled this for consideration in a future version of the framework.

                                Change ringing can be viewed as having two separate branches: method ringing and call change ringing.
                                (The term 'call changes' is probably a simplification of what originally may have been 'called changes'.)
                                When looking at how the framework (and previously the Decisions) supports method ringing,
                                one finds that call change ringing doesn't require the same support.
                                There's no central library of call change callings, no tradition of publishing call change performances,
                                or ringing record lengths of call changes, and no practice of classifying call changes
                                or extending sets of call changes to give related sets at higher stages.
                                While there's no reason why the above couldn't develop, it hasn't to date.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For the reasons above, and also so we can keep our focus on implementing the framework for method ringing sooner rather than later,
                                we therefore don't propose to include a description of call change ringing in the framework at this stage.
                                However, there may be a case for adding this in a subsequent version of the framework if the
                                ringing community thinks this would be useful.
                                Alternatively, a separate framework for call change ringing could be developed.
                                In either case, this should be led by specialists in the call changes field.

                                We think it would be too confusing and complicated to have (a) methods reported using more than one name,
                                and (b) the previous name of a method whose name has been changed
                                (e.g. due to a classification change that resulted in a naming conflict)
                                to be reserved against future use.
                                We think a better approach is for the methods library to be able to record alternative names
                                by which certain methods are known, and for these names to be searchable within the library.

                                the framework (see Appendix F.1).
                                Some methods will get a new title (= name + class + stage) because of classification changes,
                                but the vast majority of these will keep the same method name.

                                Item 4 of Appendix B (Method Name Syntax) describes the process for determining
                                whether two method names are considered the same.
                                The aim of this process is to prevent method names being so similar that they could easily be confused.
                                E.g. London No. 3 and London No 3 would be considered the same under this process.
                                However, the process doesn't go as far as eliminating all spaces betweeen other
                                characters.  Multiple spaces are reduced to a single space, but a single space
                                is considered different from no space.
                                London No 3 would therefore be considered different from Londonno3.
                                There are already examples of this in the method library --
                                for example, Whitehall Suprise Major and White Hall Surprise Major have both been named,
                                as have Christchurch Surprise Royal and Christ Church Surprise Royal.
                                The Technical & Taxonomy Workgroup will review similar method names when they occur,
                                and may request that a band uses a different name to avoid possible confusion.

                                A very important aspect of the new framework is that we are not seeking to allow or disallow certain
                                types of ringing.
                                Instead we're aiming to provide standard terminology that enables ringers
                                to describe what they rang, so that other ringers can read about ringing performances
                                and be clear on what was rung.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Whole pull ringing doesn't follow the norms of method ringing.
                                Under Section 6.C n) the report of a whole pull performance should therefore include a disclosure that the composition was rung in whole pulls.
                                As noted above, whole pull ringing can work well when the bells are half-muffled.

                                The framework team agrees. The first version of the framework won't be perfect,
                                and it's doubtful there could ever be a perfect framework.
                                We envisage a process of continous improvement to the framework over time
                                as issues and inconsistencies are discovered, and as method ringing continues to evolve.

                                <i>My own belief is that you should stop describing this work as 'technical' in the sense of difficult for ordinary people to understand.
                                It is 'technical' in that it relates to a detailed understanding of what a method is. And for that, of course, it takes time to absorb in detail.
                                However, if any of the framework requires additional (undocumented within the framework) knowledge in order to understand what the framework means, then this is a failure.
                                I am not a composer, method designer, and not a very experienced conductor, but I am perfectly capable of understanding what these mean and their significance to the Exercise.
                                And perhaps one day I might become one of these things, so making it accessible (which on the whole you have succeeded at) would help that to happen.
                                You should also stop portraying this work as 'of interest to only a few ringers'. This is only partly true.
                                Most ringers assume they are not interested because they are continually told it is not interesting.
                                But every ringer understands that a method name consists of a title, a classification and a stage.
                                This is part of the framework and is built into how we teach people about ringing.
                                OK, the very finest detail is more esoteric, but then so are certain aspects of ringing history, or bellframe construction, or safeguarding issues,
                                none of which we portray as too difficult for the ordinary ringer to understand.</i>

                                knowledge in order to understand what the framework means, and this has been one of our key goals.
                                We hope we've achieved this, but welcome any suggestions on an ongoing basis on how the framework might be made clearer.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It hasn't been our intention to portray the framework as 'too difficult for the ordinary ringer to understand'.
                                The framework is 'technical' in the sense that it includes theory and mechanics of method ringing,
                                so the fine detail may be of more interest to specialists than to generalists,
                                but the fundamental content underpins method ringing and should be accessible to any interested ringer.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We have been cautious not to give the impression that we think every ringer ought to be spending lots of time studying the framework.
                                Ringing has lots of problems to solve, including existential ones relating to the declining number of ringers and ageing demographics.
                                We therefore wanted to get the balance right in saying there is value in having a well-thought-out framework for describing method ringing,
                                but there are also many other challenges facing the Exercise that need ringers' time and energy.

                                Irregular spacing and handstroke gaps are elements of striking.
                                We decided for this first version of the framework only to make a general
                                exhortation on good striking (see the definition of Performance - 3.K.1).
                                We've also included a general ringing quality criterion to the role of
                                umpire(s) in record lengths -- see 7.B.5.
                                We've added handstroke gaps / cartwheeling, bell spacing and similar topics
                                to the list of items for consideration in a subsequent version of the framework.

                                Good question. Giving a new lower stage method the same name as an existing higher stage method isn't precluded
                                provided the methods are related.
                                E.g. assume XYZ Maximus has been rung and named.
                                If a Major method is rung, and an extension process can be applied to the Major method
                                to obtain XYZ Maximus, then the Major and Maximus methods are related.
                                The Major method can therefore be named XYZ Major if all other extension requirements are met.
                                The term 'parent' doesn't imply that the parent method was rung and named before any extensions
                                were rung / named.  Parent is just the lower or lowest stage method in a set of related methods.

                                Agreed. We've now expanded 7.B.5 to include, in general terms, the type of checking the umpire(s) should do.
                                Also, 6.C.2.g states the norm that 'No person not ringing provided any assistance in the execution of the ringing during the Performance, e.g. making calls, detecting or correcting errors.'
                                This replaces the 'No assistance of any kind' language of the Decisions.
                                This means that if an umpire (or any other person present), say, picks up a ringer's water bottle that has fallen out of the ringer's reach,
                                this is acceptable as it isn't assistance with the execution of the ringing.
                                The same would apply to turning on a light, turning off a heater, etc.

                                This may be the single most contentious issue that has emerged during the framework project,
                                so here's a longer answer covering this point.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Clearly there's a strong link between the word 'peal' and the ringing of an extent of Triples,
                                and in fact in the early days of ringing, peal was also used to describe the ringing of an extent of Minor.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It might have been more elegant if peals at all stages had originally been defined as 5040 or more changes.
                                But peals of less than 5040 started to be rung for Major and above as early as 1755,
                                and so the 5000 minimum for higher stages is long established, and dates to well before the Central Council was formed.
                            </p>

                                While many people would like to see 5040 retained as the minimum length for a peal of Triples,
                                there are many others who support the simpler and more consistent approach of peals having a minimum length of 5000 changes at all stages.
                                The limited data we have suggests a split of around 60/40, with the majority favoring standardisation on 5000 at all stages.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It's important to note that the framework gives ranges for the different performance lengths -- e.g. a QP is 1250 - 2499,
                                and a half peal is 2500 - 4999.  In this context, a peal having a range of 5000 - 9999 and being part of a bigger
                                sequence of performance lengths supports standardisation on a 5000 minimum.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It’s perhaps also worth noting that the length of the extent isn't part of ringing’s performance terminology anywhere else.
                                For example, a QP of Minor is reasonably close to two extents, but there wasn’t a move to make 1440 the minimum number of changes for a Minor QP.
                                This isn’t a directly comparable situation given we recognise that the concept of a peal originated from the goal of ringing an extent.
                                But it highlights that we can view standard performance ranges (&lt;1250, 1250-2499, 2500-4999, 5000-9999, and &gt;=10000) as distinct from extent lengths (24, 120, 720, 5040) which are single numbers.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Setting the minimin length at 5000 for all stages allows those who want to continue ringing no less than 5040 to do so.
                                But setting the definition at 5040 takes away the option of ringing between 5000 and 5039 from those who want it.
                                Using 5000 is therefore the permissive option.  It’s clearly also the simpler option, as a peal can have the same definition across all stages.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There could be a separate carve-out for Triples – i.e. for all stages except Triples, a peal requires a minimum of 5000 changes,
                                but for Triples the minimum is 5040.
                                But this then raises several other questions: should a QP of Triples (the length that enables a new method to be named) be 1260 instead of 1250?
                                Is a half peal of Triples 2520 and a long length of Triples 10080?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There could also be valid reasons for wanting to ring 5000-5039 Triples.  There might be a wish to ring a peal in this length
                                range for an anniversary of the last two numbers (e.g. a 5026 for a 26th birthday) and only a Triples band is available.
                                There could be an interesting compositional reason for doing so -- e.g. there's a true, non-round 5039 of Grandsire Triples
                                that only uses bobs.
                                For over two centuries, composers have been searching for a bobs-only extent of Erin Triples.  So far, the longest
                                true bobs-only round block found is 4990 changes.  If, say, a 5004 is found (before any longer length),
                                a number of ringers would be interested in ringing it.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                Even with a move to a standard minimum peal length of 5000, we can be sure that the vast majority of Triples peals will continue to be 5040 changes in length.
                                There is, of course, something very elegant and appealing about ringing every possible row exactly once.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In 2016, the Decisions were relaxed to allow peals of Triples (and lower stages) to include partial extents.
                                Previously a peal of Triples could only be whole multiples of extents (5040, 10080, 15120, etc).
                                Under the current Decisions, they can be any length that is 5040 or higher.
                                Since that update, 353 peals of Triples have been posted on BellBoard (at the time of writing).
                                Only one of them took advantage of the Decision change -- a 5320 of Grandsire Triples -- the rest were all 5040s.
                                The 5320 was an interesting performance because the composition was bobs only -- not something that can be done in a 5040 of Grandsire Triples.
                                We have similar expectations that ringers will only choose to ring between 5000 and 5039 of Triples when there is a specific reason for doing so.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We’ve therefore retained 5000 as the minimum length for peals across all stages.
                                This is the permissive approach, and keeping ringing terminology as simple and consistent as possible makes things easier for new ringers joining the Exercise.
                                No one has to ring a 5000 – 5039 of Triples if they don’t want to, but equally we don't think anyone should try to prevent those who do want to ring a 5000 – 5039 of Triples from claiming a peal,
                                given this number meets the requirement for a peal at other stages.
                                In any community such as ours there will be a wide range of opinions, and ultimately it's beneficial if we can find ways to coexist as peacefully as possible.
                                No one thinks a 4999 should be a peal (ok, you could probably find someone who thinks this), but there are many ringers who would like to see 5000 as the minimum peal length across all stages.
                                The 5040 supporters can still choose never to ring peals of Triples that are less than 5040 changes.
                                Live and let live.

                                This is the known problem of overlap -- there isn't a way to define method ringing such
                                that there is only one valid way to describe any given sequence of changes.
                                E.g. Stedman can also be described as spliced Erin and Bastow Little Bob.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Any attempt to enforce a single way of defining a given sequence of changes
                                results in valid ringing constructs also being ruled out.
                                We therefore leave it to ringers to use their good judgement in deciding
                                the best way to describe any given sequence of changes.

                                Agreed. Put another way, and replacing N with M in your second sentence,
                                we can say that any touch can be given a pair of numbers, N and M, relating
                                to its truth.<br />
                                For no rows repeated, N = 1 (e.g. a normal peal of Triples of higher);<br />
                                For complete, N = M (e.g. two extents of Grandsire Doubles, where N and M = 2);<br />
                                For truth as defined in the framework, N - M <= 1.<br />

                                We found that we didn't need to define Complete for use elsewhere in the framework,
                                though it is a commonly-used term when discussing truth.
                                We therefore didn't include Complete in the interests of simplicity.
