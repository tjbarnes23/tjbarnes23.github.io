                                No. The reason this isn't needed is because alternative B always classifies a hunter based on the path of the treble, regardless of how many hunt bells there are. This is viewed as aligning more closely with the historic terms used -- treble bob, treble dodging, treble place.

                                Agree they weren't easy to compare as presented -- apologies for that.  As noted in the [add date] RW article,
                                we have now settled on a classification proposal to put forward -- it falls somewhere between Alt A and
                                Alt B, and is the single classification section now included in this website.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However, we will still aim to put together a table that compares the classifications used in the Decisions,
                                Alt A and Alt B, and the final classification proposal used in the framework.

                                We intend Hunting, as a standalone term, to mean hunting in a single direction (i.e. either hunting up or hunting down).
                                The main use of hunting is in the definition of a Place method, in which the paths of all the bells consist only of Hunting and Making Places.

                                This is distinct from a Plain Hunt Path (or Plain Hunting Path), which consists of hunting up, making a place, hunting down and making another place.
                                While Plain Hunt Path isn't a term we needed to define for use elsewhere,
                                we've now included this term in the further explanation of the Plain Method class definition (see Section 4.D.1).

                                <i>There seems to be a tendency in ringing and in business to introduce a new vocabulary which the older practitioners
                                find difficult to understand, so perhaps a glossary of terms might be given somewhere.
                                Reports of peals in the RW now refer to cyclical and particles and it would be helpful to the rank and file ringers
                                if these terms could be explained.</i>

                                Words have been capitalized in the framework when they are a specialist ringing term that is defined elsewhere in the framework
                                (per Section 2.A.5).  A better approach might be to italicize the words rather than capitalize them,
                                and make them hyperlinks to the definition in question (which also gives the option of presenting them underlined or in a different color).
                                As noted elsewhere, there is various scope for improving the appearance of the framework website -- this is something we plan to look at for

                                Identity was chosen because it's used in mathematics to denote an operation that, when applied to an input, produces an output that is the same as the input.
                                E.g. the identity for addition is zero, because n + 0 = n.  In change ringing, we apply a change to a row in order to produce a new row, so it's
                                consistent to call the change that results in a new row that's the same as the previous row the identity change.
                                'Null change' has also been used in the past for the identity change.  A discussion about this in the ringing-theory email group indicated a preference for identity over null.

                                The are various terms in method ringing that have similar meanings (e.g. touch and composition),
                                as well as terms that have more than one meaning (e.g. lead can refer to ringing in 1st's place or a lead of a method).
                                We've tried to distinguish similar terms as best we can:
                                We view a method as just the sequence of changes, without considering the rows that the method can be used to generate.<br />
                                A block, on the other hand, results from applying a sequence of changes (i.e. a method or a composition) to a starting row (normally rounds).
                                A block therefore comprises a set of rows and the changes used to generate them.<br />
                                Related to these terms, a touch is a block generated by a composition,
                                and a plain lead and a plain course are blocks generated by a single method without any calls.

                                We considered this, but the difficulty is that there will be lots of different views on where
                                to draw the line between vanilla and exotic.
                                This approach could also make it harder for readers to find the information they're looking for.
                                However, we will consider this in more detail for a subsequent version of the framework.

                                <i>I was unclear about the use of stage at various points in the framework.
                                There seem to be requirements of various terms to be all “of the same stage” which did not make sense to my mind as it
                                precluded blocks/compositions of spliced triples and major (given the commonplace understanding of the term “stage”).
                                However, an explanation is found hidden away in explanatory notes for cover bells.
                                I think that something should be done to enable a clearer understanding of this concept in the main text,
                                especially as various sections of the explanatory notes relate; not everything is one place.
                                (I also do not understand why Plain Bob Doubles/Plain Bob Minor rung side by side on 12 produces Maximus changes
                                as there are 11 bells affected by the method – so surely this would be cinques changes
                                as per the example given elsewhere of Plain Bob Minor/Plain Bob Cinques rung side by side).</i>

                                <i>Although the meaning is clear at all times in your text, I feel that there is a potential for misunderstanding in the use of the word 'extent'.
                                It is commonly used to mean (eg on 5) "all 120 possible changes rung consecutively".
                                Thus "call two extents of Grandsire Doubles" would widely be interpreted to mean calling a 120 then another 120 immediately following,
                                while a 240 that has each row once at hand and once at back would more often be called a "double-extent".
                                But in your usage this 240 could be called "two extents" as each change occurs twice, but the two extents are intertwined.
                                You seem to anticipate this possible confusion by adding the clarifying remark "The location of individual Rows within a Block of Rows does not have any bearing on truth."
                                Good - but I feel there is still a need to point out these two different possible interpretations of the word "extent" - or maybe have two different words???

                                Change ringing can be viewed as having two separate branches: method ringing and call change ringing.
                                (The term 'call changes' is probably a simplification of what originally may have been 'called changes'.)
                                When looking at how the framework (and previously the Decisions) supports method ringing,
                                one finds that call change ringing doesn't require the same support.
                                There's no central library of call change callings, no tradition of publishing call change performances,
                                or ringing record lengths of call changes, and no practice of classifying call changes
                                or extending sets of call changes to give related sets at higher stages.
                                While there's no reason why the above couldn't develop, it hasn't thus far.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For the reasons above, and also so we can keep our focus on implementing the framework for method ringing sooner rather than later,
                                we therefore don't propose to include a description of call change ringing in the framework at this stage.
                                However, there may be a case for adding this in a subsequent version of the framework if the
                                ringing community thinks this would be useful.

                                We recognize that jump changes is a divisive topic, and some ringers don't consider them to be part of method ringing.
                                In line with our descriptive / permissive mandate, we've included jump changes in the framework.
                                But to enable ringers who object to jump changes to be able to ignore any reported performances that include them,
                                we felt disclosure was needed.  Note that since methods that include jump changes will have 'Jump' in their method
                                titles, disclosure is only required when jump calls are used with non-jump methods
                                (see the further explanation of Section 6.C.2).

                                <i>I would urge the proponents of these changes to tread very carefully indeed.
                                History shows that when traditional and ingrained systems are swept away, those who are not prepared to put up with it
                                will break away from the existing structures and form their own traditional groups.
                                Anglicanism is a good example where there are now thousands of traditionalists broken away from Lambeth throughout the world.
                                An alternative Council of Traditional English Change Ringers would be a disaster for the art given the challenges to ringing
                                posed by on-going collapse of the Church of England.</i>

                                The Decisions have been a source of controversy since the formation of the Council, and many believe
                                the Decisions' approach of ruling out ringing that hasn't been done before has harmed the Council's reputation,
                                especially among more advanced ringers. The motion to switch to a descriptive / permissive approach
                                passed with a very clear majority at the Edinburgh CC meeting.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However we recognize that traditionalists won't like all the forms of method ringing that the framework describes.
                                The framework uses a disclosure approach so that performances that differed from method ringing norms
                                can be identified as such.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There is also, deliberately, nothing in the framework that prevents a group of traditionalist ringers
                                from forming a Society (which can become affiliated with the Central Council) that implements additional
                                restrictions on what is considers methods or peals.
                                For example, this Society might choose to only recognize peals of Triples and below that are rung
                                in whole extents, and that only include methods that are principles or have Plain Bob leadheads / leadends.

                            <p>
                                Ultimately ringers with a wide range of opinions have to find ways to coexist with one another,
                                and we believe that a descriptive / permissive approach, paired with disclosure and the ability
                                of like-minded ringers to form societies that focus on the types of ringing they're interested in,
                                is the most likely way to achieve this.

                                <i>I think that what we should strive to avoid is offending against first principles of change ringing that have been established for centuries.
                                Thus I cannot support the introduction of jump changes and multiple covering bells in peals.
                                The peal is a benchmark of achievement and there is no case for allowing people who can barely handle a bell in Rounds
                                to follow another bell for three hours in the pretense that they are now a peal ringer.
                                Extra covering bells have a place in Quarters to give rope-time to learners, but not in peal ringing.
                                If this is permitted we will soon see a peal of Minimus rung on 12 with 8 covering bells which would bring our art into disrepute.</i>

                                <i>It appears from what has been published that a recordable peal could now be rung on 1 and 2 bells.
                                That is a nonsense. However what I do want to see, and have advocated for many years is the acceptance of Singles.
                                I do not see a case for saying that a band who have worked away at a probably rough 3 for nearly three hours have not rung a Peal.
                                Singles should be the basic minimum stage for change ringing.</i>

                                The abolition of traditional standards is a disease. Ringing should work towards improving standards, not abolishing them to placate the PC brigade.</i>

                                Much Central Council time was taken up debating whether 4-bell peals should be recognized.
                                We could clearly spend more time debating whether 3-bell peals should be recognized, and then 2-bell peals.
                                Similarly, we could spend much time in the future debating whether jump changes and multiple cover bells should be recognized.
                                With the CRAG mandate, the Council has recognized this is not a good approach.
                                The mandate was very clear -- the aim of the framework is to be permissive and describe what ringers choose to ring,
                                rather than specifying rules over what the Council will and will not recognize.
                                This is a direct response by the Council to the recognition that the previoius system hasn't worked well,
                                has caused much controversy, and has harmed the Council's reputation, obscuring much of its other good work.
                                It's now time to try something new -- namely to provide standard terminology for ringers to describe what they rang,
                                and leave it to them to decide what they want to ring.
                            </p>

                                The aim of trying to use the framework to enforce ringing standards (i.e. quality) is also misguided in our view.
                                Standards vary widely by band and location, and a one-size-fits-all central approach will inevitably
                                result in the bar being set too high for some and too low for others.
                                Encouraging improved ringing quality is better addressed at the local level,
                                with the Central Council possibly providing guidance / tips, and/or promoting training events and similar.

                                This is the question of whether the identity change should be recognized.
                                For example, an extent of Plain Bob Doubles can be turned into a true 240 by calling a
                                single with place notation 12345 at two points 120 changes apart.
                                This 240 has the nice feature of every row appearing once at handstroke and once at backstroke.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Since a 12345 change results in every bell staying in the same place from one row to the next,
                                it is the identity change for Doubles.
                                Given the valid use of identity changes as in the example above, and that
                                our mandate is to be permissive and decriptive, we believe the identity
                                change should be included in the framework.  It is then up to individual
                                bands to decide whether they want to make use of it.

                                A very important aspect of the new framework is that we are not seeking to allow or disallow certain
                                types of ringing.
                                Instead we are seeking to provide a common terminology that enables ringers
                                to describe what they rang, such that other ringers can read about ringing performances
                                and be clear on what was rung.
                            </p>

                                Whole pull ringing doesn't follow the norms of method ringing.
                                Under Section 6.C n) the report of a whole pull performance should therefore include a disclosure that the composition was rung in whole pulls.
                                As noted above, whole pull ringing can work well when the bells are half-muffled.

                                The framework team agrees. The first version of the framework won't be perfect,
                                and it's doubtful there could ever be a perfect framework.
                                We envisage a process of continous imrprovement to the framework over time
                                as issues and inconsistencies are discovered, and as method ringing continues to evolve.

                                <i>My own belief is that you should stop describing this work as 'technical' in the sense of difficult for ordinary people to understand.
                                It is 'technical' in that it relates to a detailed understanding of what a method is. And for that, of course, it takes time to absorb in detail.
                                However, if any of the framework requires additional (undocumented within the framework) knowledge in order to understand what the framework means, then this is a failure.
                                I am not a composer, method designer, and not a very experienced conductor, but I am perfectly capable of understanding what these mean and their significance to the Exercise.
                                And perhaps one day I might become one of these things, so making it accessible (which on the whole you have succeeded at) would help that to happen.
                                You should also stop portraying this work as 'of interest to only a few ringers'. This is only partly true.
                                Most ringers assume they are not interested because they are continually told it is not interesting.
                                But every ringer understands that a method name consists of a title, a classification and a stage.
                                This is part of the framework and is built into how we teach people about ringing.
                                OK, the very finest detail is more esoteric, but then so are certain aspects of ringing history, or bellframe construction, or safeguarding issues,
                                none of which we portray as too difficult for the ordinary ringer to understand.</i>

                                <i>I could follow most of [Section 13 -- Method Extension Processes] (the diagrams are helpful),
                                but I didn't understand just what a 'mode' was and what it was supposed to mean.
                                It also wasn't clear that the example was Mode=2 from the supplied diagrams.
                                What is the significance of Mode=2, and how is is different from Mode=1 or Mode=6?
                                I understood that Mode has a number between 1 and the Stage (so 6 in this example),
                                but I don't understand what the significance of the selection is.
                                This seems important for the remainder of the criteria and how each section is defined.</i>

                                We've added some additional explanation of mode in Section 13, which hopefully clears this up [to be added].
                                Here's a standalone example:
                                Assume a Treble Dodging Major method has place notation below the treble of x12x 3 for sections F G.
                                (F = treble in 5-6; G = treble in 6-7.)
                                When creating sections E2 F2 for the Royal extension (E2 = treble in 7-8; F2 = treble in 8-9), if the mode was 1, E2 F2 would be x14x 5.
                                This is because mode 1 means any place made in 1st's place or below remains the same in the extension, and any place
                                made in 2nd's place or higher moves up 2 places.
                                So the 1 in 12 is unchanged, but the 2 in 12 moves up to 4, and the 3 moves up to 5.
                                If the mode was 2, E2 F2 would be x12x 5, because mode 2 means any place made in 2nd's place or below remains the same in the extension, and any place
                                made in 3rd's place or higher moves up 2 places.
                                Similarly, if the mode was 3 or higher, E2 F2 would be x12x 3 (i.e. the same as E F).

                                Is it possible to name a method on 12 and it therefore becomes the Parent which then potentially
                                precludes the use of the same name for lower numbers, given the current definition?</i>

                                Giving a new lower stage method the same name as an existing higher stage method isn't precluded
                                provided the methods are related.
                                E.g. assume XYZ Maximus has been rung and named.
                                If a Major method is rung, and an extension process can be applied to the Major method
                                to obtain XYZ Maximus, then the Major and Maximus methods are related.
                                The Major method can therefore be named XYZ Major if all other extension requirements are met.
                                The term "parent" doesn't imply that the parent method was rung and named before any extensions
                                were rung / named.  Parent is just the lower or lowest stage method in a set of related methods.

                                instances, we felt that "umpires' report" is part of the record length vernacular.

                                This might be the single most contentious issue that has emerged during the framework project,
                                so here's a longer answer covering this point.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Clearly there's a strong link between the word 'peal' and the ringing of an extent of Triples,
                                and in fact in the early days of ringing, peal was also used to describe the ringing of an extent of Minor.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It might have been more elegant if peals at all stages had originally been defined as 5040 or more changes.
                                But peals of less than 5040 started to be rung for Major and above as early as 1755,
                                and so the 5000 minimum for higher stages is long established, and dates to well before the Central Council was formed.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                While many people would like to see 5040 retained as the minimum length for a peal of Triples,
                                there are many others who support peals having a minimum length of 5000 changes at all stages.
                                The limited data we have suggests a split of around 60/40 on this difficult question.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It’s perhaps also worth noting that the length of the extent isn't part of ringing’s performance terminology anywhere else.
                                For example, a QP of Minor is reasonably close to two extents, but there wasn’t a move to make 1440 the minimum number of changes for a Minor QP.
                                This isn’t a directly comparable situation given that we all recognize that the concept of a peal originated from the goal of ringing an extent of Triples.
                                But it highlights that we can view standard performance boundaries (1250, 2500, 5000, 10000) as distinct from extent lengths (24, 120, 720, 5040).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Setting the definition as 5000 for all stages allows those who want to continue ringing no less than 5040 to do so.
                                But setting the definition at 5040 takes away the option of ringing between 5000 and 5039 from those who want it.
                                Using 5000 is therefore the permissive option.  It’s clearly also the simpler option, as a peal can have the same definition across all stages.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There could be a separate carve-out for Triples – i.e. for all stages except Triples, a peal requires a minimum of 5000 changes,
                                but for Triples the minimum is 5040.
                                But this then raises several other questions: should a QP of Triples (the length that enables a new method to be named) be 1260 instead of 1250?
                                Is a half peal of Triples 2520 and a long length of Triples 10080?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There could be valid reasons for wanting to ring 5000-5039 Triples.  There might be a wish to ring a peal in this length
                                for an anniversary of the last two numbers (e.g. a 5026 for a 26th birthday) and only a Triples band is available.
                                There could be an interesting compositional reason for doing so -- e.g. there's a true, non-round 5039 of Grandsire Triples
                                that only uses bobs.
                                For over two centuries, composers have been searching for a bobs-only extent of Erin Triples.  So far, the longest
                                true bobs-only touch found is [4940] changes.  If, say, a 5004 is found (before any longer length),
                                a number of ringers would be interested in ringing it.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                Even with a move to a standard minimum peal length of 5000, we can be sure that the vast majority of Triples peals will continue to be 5040 changes in length.
                                There is, of course, something very elegant and appealing about ringing every possible row exactly once.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In 2014, the Decisions were relaxed to allow peals of Triples to include partial extents.
                                Previously a peal of Triples could only be whole multiples of extents (5040, 10080, 15120, etc).
                                Under the current Decisions, they can be any length that is 5040 or higher.
                                Since that update, 317 peals of Triples have been posted on BellBoard.
                                Only one of them took advantage of the Decision change -- a 5320 of Grandsire Triples.
                                This was an interesting performance because the composition was bobs only -- not something that can be done in a 5040 of Grandsire Triples.
                                We have similar expectations that ringers will only choose to ring between 5000 and 5039 of Triples when there is a specific reason for doing so.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We’ve therefore retained 5000 as the minimum length for peals across all stages.
                                This is the permissive approach, and keeping ringing terminology as simple and consistent as possible makes things easier for new ringers joining the Exercise.
                                No one has to ring a 5000 – 5039 of Triples if they don’t want to, but equally we don't think anyone should try to prevent those who do want to ring a 5000 – 5039 of Triples from claiming a peal,
                                given this number meets the requirement for a peal at other stages.
                                In any community such as ours there will be a wide range of opionions, and ultimately it's beneficial if we can find ways to coexist as peacefully as possible.
                                No one thinks a 4992 should be a peal (ok, you could probably find someone who thinks this), but there are many ringers who would like to see 5000 as the minimum peal length across all stages.
                                The 5040 supporters can still choose never to ring peals of Triples of less than 5040.
                                Live and let live.
