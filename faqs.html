                                No. The reason this isn't needed is because alternative B always classifies a hunter based on the path of the treble, regardless of how many hunt bells there are. This is viewed as aligning more closely with the historic terms used -- treble bob, treble dodging, treble place.

                                we have now settled on a classification proposal to put forward -- it falls somewhere between Alt A and
                                Alt B, and is the single classification section now included in this website.

                                However, we will still aim to put together a table that compares the classifications used in the Decisions,
                                Alt A and Alt B, and the final classification proposal used in the framework.

                                We intend Hunting, as a standalone term, to mean hunting in a single direction (i.e. either hunting up or hunting down).
                                The main use of hunting is in the definition of a Place method, in which the paths of all the bells consist only of Hunting and Making Places.

                                This is distinct from a Plain Hunt Path (or Plain Hunting Path), which consists of hunting up, making a place, hunting down and making another place.
                                While Plain Hunt Path isn't a term we needed to define for use elsewhere,
                                we've now included this term in the further explanation of the Plain Method class definition (see Section 4.D.1).

                                The are various overlapping terms in method ringing (e.g. touch and composition),
                                as well as the same term having more than one meaning (e.g. lead can refer to ringing in 1st's place or a lead of a method).
                                We've tried to distinguish these as well as possible.
                                When talking about a method, we are only referring to a sequence of changes.  When referring to a block,
                                the method is applied to a starting row to obtain a set of rows.  A block is therefore a specific application of a method.
                                Similarly a composition is only a set of changes.  When applied to a starting row a touch is produced, which is a specific application
                                of a composition.  [To be completed / refined]

                                (per Section 2.A.5).  A better approach might be to italicize the words rather than capitalize them,
                                and make them hyperlinks to the definition in question (which also gives the option of presenting them underlined or in a different color).

                                Identity was chosen because it's used in mathematics to denote an operation that, when applied to an input, produces an output that is the same as the input.
                                E.g. the identity for addition is zero, because n + 0 = n.  In change ringing, we apply a change to a row in order to produce a new row, so it's
                                consistent to call the change that results in a new row that's the same as the previous row the identity change.
                                'Null change' has also been used in the past for the identity change.  A discussion about this in the ringing-theory email group indicated a preference for identity over null.

                                Change ringing can be viewed as having two separate branches: method ringing and call change ringing.
                                (The term 'call changes' is probably a simplification of what originally may have been 'called changes'.)
                                When looking at how the framework (and previously the Decisions) supports method ringing,
                                one finds that call change ringing doesn't require the same support.
                                There's no central library of call change callings, no tradition of publishing call change performances,
                                or ringing record lengths of call changes, and no practice of classifying call changes
                                or extending sets of call changes to give related sets at higher stages.
                                While there's no reason why the above couldn't develop, it hasn't thus far.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For the reasons above, and also so we can keep our focus on implementing the framework for method ringing sooner rather than later,
                                we therefore don't propose to include a description of call change ringing in the framework at this stage.
                                However, there may be a case for adding this in a subsequent version of the framework if the
                                ringing community thinks this would be useful.

                                We recognize that jump changes is a divisive topic, and some ringers don't consider them to be part of method ringing.
                                In line with our descriptive / permissive mandate, we've included jump changes in the framework.
                                But to enable ringers who object to jump changes to be able to ignore any reported performances that include them,
                                we felt disclosure was needed.  Note that since methods that include jump changes will have 'Jump' in their method
                                titles, disclosure is only required when jump calls are used with non-jump methods
                                (see the further explanation of Section 6.C.2).

                                <i>I would urge the proponents of these changes to tread very carefully indeed.
                                History shows that when traditional and ingrained systems are swept away, those who are not prepared to put up with it
                                will break away from the existing structures and form their own traditional groups.
                                Anglicanism is a good example where there are now thousands of traditionalists broken away from Lambeth throughout the world.
                                An alternative Council of Traditional English Change Ringers would be a disaster for the art given the challenges to ringing
                                posed by on-going collapse of the Church of England.</i>

                                The Decisions have been a source of controversy since the formation of the Council, and many believe
                                the Decisions' approach of ruling out ringing that hasn't been done before has harmed the Council's reputation,
                                especially among more advanced ringers. The motion to switch to a descriptive / permissive approach
                                passed with a very clear majority at the Edinburgh CC meeting.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However we recognize that traditionalists won't like all the forms of method ringing that the framework describes.
                                The framework uses a disclosure approach so that performances that differed from method ringing norms
                                can be identified as such.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There is also, deliberately, nothing in the framework that prevents a group of traditionalist ringers
                                from forming a Society (which can become affiliated with the Central Council) that implements additional
                                restrictions on what is considers methods or peals.
                                For example, this Society might choose to only recognize peals of Triples and below that are rung
                                in whole extents, and that only include methods that are principles or have Plain Bob leadheads / leadends.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Ultimately ringers with a wide range of opinions have to find ways to coexist with one another,
                                and we believe that a descriptive / permissive approach, paired with disclosure and the ability
                                of like-minded ringers to form societies that focus on the types of ringing they're interested in,
                                is the most likely way to achieve this.

                                A very important aspect of the new framework is that we are not seeking to allow or disallow certain
                                types of ringing.
                                Instead we are seeking to provide a common terminology that enables ringers
                                to describe what they rang, such that other ringers can read about ringing performances
                                and be clear on what was rung.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Whole pull ringing doesn't follow the norms of method ringing.
                                Under Section 6.C n) the report of a whole pull performance should therefore include a disclosure that the composition was rung in whole pulls.
                                As noted above, whole pull ringing can work well when the bells are half-muffled.

                                The framework team agrees. The first version of the framework won't be perfect,
                                and it's doubtful there could ever be a perfect framework.
                                We envisage a process of continous imrprovement to the framework over time
                                as issues and inconsistencies are discovered, and as method ringing continues to evolve.

                                It also wasn't clear that the example was Mode=2 from the supplied diagrams.
                                What is the significance of Mode=2, and how is is different from Mode=1 or Mode=6?
                                I understood that Mode has a number between 1 and the Stage (so 6 in this example),

                                We've added some additional explanation of mode in Section 13, which hopefully clears this up [to be added].
                                Here's a standalone example:
                                Assume a Treble Dodging Major method has place notation below the treble of x12x 3 for sections F G.
                                (F = treble in 5-6; G = treble in 6-7.)
                                When creating sections E2 F2 for the Royal extension (E2 = treble in 7-8; F2 = treble in 8-9), if the mode was 1, E2 F2 would be x14x 5.
                                This is because mode 1 means any place made in 1st's place or below remains the same in the extension, and any place
                                made in 2nd's place or higher moves up 2 places.
                                So the 1 in 12 is unchanged, but the 2 in 12 moves up to 4, and the 3 moves up to 5.
                                If the mode was 2, E2 F2 would be x12x 5, because mode 2 means any place made in 2nd's place or below remains the same in the extension, and any place
                                made in 3rd's place or higher moves up 2 places.
                                Similarly, if the mode was 3 or higher, E2 F2 would be x12x 3 (i.e. the same as E F).

                                Giving a new lower stage method the same name as an existing higher stage method isn't precluded
                                provided the methods are related.
                                E.g. assume XYZ Maximus has been rung and named.
                                If a Major method is rung, and an extension process can be applied to the Major method
                                to obtain XYZ Maximus, then the Major and Maximus methods are related.
                                The Major method can therefore be named XYZ Major if all other extension requirements are met.
                                The term "parent" doesn't imply that the parent method was rung and named before any extensions
                                were rung / named.  Parent is just the lower or lowest stage method in a set of related methods.

                                This might be the single most contentious issue that has emerged during the framework project,
                                so here's a longer answer covering this point.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Clearly there's a strong link between the word 'peal' and the ringing of an extent of Triples,
                                and in fact in the early days of ringing, peal was also used to describe the ringing of an extent of Minor.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It might have been more elegant if peals at all stages had originally been defined as 5040 or more changes.
                                But peals of less than 5040 started to be rung for Major and above as early as 1755,
                                and so the 5000 minimum for higher stages is long established, and dates to well before the Central Council was formed.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                While many people would like to see 5040 retained as the minimum length for a peal of Triples,
                                there are many others who support peals having a minimum length of 5000 changes at all stages.
                                The limited data we have suggests a split of around 60/40 on this difficult question.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                It’s perhaps also worth noting that the length of the extent isn't part of ringing’s performance terminology anywhere else.
                                For example, a QP of Minor is reasonably close to two extents, but there wasn’t a move to make 1440 the minimum number of changes for a Minor QP.
                                This isn’t a directly comparable situation given that we all recognize that the concept of a peal originated from the goal of ringing an extent of Triples.
                                But it highlights that we can view standard performance boundaries (1250, 2500, 5000, 10000) as distinct from extent lengths (24, 120, 720, 5040).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Setting the definition as 5000 for all stages allows those who want to continue ringing no less than 5040 to do so.
                                But setting the definition at 5040 takes away the option of ringing between 5000 and 5039 from those who want it.
                                Using 5000 is therefore the permissive option.  It’s clearly also the simpler option, as a peal can have the same definition across all stages.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There could be a separate carve-out for Triples – i.e. for all stages except Triples, a peal requires a minimum of 5000 changes,
                                but for Triples the minimum is 5040.
                                But this then raises several other questions: should a QP of Triples (the length that enables a new method to be named) be 1260 instead of 1250?
                                Is a half peal of Triples 2520 and a long length of Triples 10080?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                There could be valid reasons for wanting to ring 5000-5039 Triples.  There might be a wish to ring a peal in this length
                                for an anniversary of the last two numbers (e.g. a 5026 for a 26th birthday) and only a Triples band is available.
                                There could be an interesting compositional reason for doing so -- e.g. there's a true, non-round 5039 of Grandsire Triples
                                that only uses bobs.
                                For over two centuries, composers have been searching for a bobs-only extent of Erin Triples.  So far, the longest
                                true bobs-only touch found is [4940] changes.  If, say, a 5004 is found (before any longer length),
                                a number of ringers would be interested in ringing it.

                                Even with a move to a standard minimum peal length of 5000, we can be sure that the vast majority of Triples peals will continue to be 5040 changes in length.
                                There is, of course, something very elegant and appealing about ringing every possible row exactly once.

                                In 2014, the Decisions were relaxed to allow peals of Triples to include partial extents.
                                Previously a peal of Triples could only be whole multiples of extents (5040, 10080, 15120, etc).
                                Under the current Decisions, they can be any length that is 5040 or higher.
                                Since that update, 317 peals of Triples have been posted on BellBoard.
                                Only one of them took advantage of the Decision change -- a 5320 of Grandsire Triples.
                                This was an interesting performance because the composition was bobs only -- not something that can be done in a 5040 of Grandsire Triples.
                                We have similar expectations that ringers will only choose to ring between 5000 and 5039 of Triples when there is a specific reason for doing so.

                                We’ve therefore retained 5000 as the minimum length for peals across all stages.
                                This is the permissive approach, and keeping ringing terminology as simple and consistent as possible makes things easier for new ringers joining the Exercise.
                                No one has to ring a 5000 – 5039 of Triples if they don’t want to, but equally we don't think anyone should try to prevent those who do want to ring a 5000 – 5039 of Triples from claiming a peal,
                                given this number meets the requirement for a peal at other stages.
                                In any community such as ours there will be a wide range of opionions, and ultimately it's beneficial if we can find ways to coexist as peacefully as possible.
                                No one thinks a 4992 should be a peal (ok, you could probably find someone who thinks this), but there are many ringers who would like to see 5000 as the minimum peal length across all stages.
                                The 5040 supporters can still choose never to ring peals of Triples of less than 5040.
                                Live and let live.
