                                Under this framework, the Classification of a small percentage of Methods in the Methods Library will change,
                                and this will cause some Method Titles to Change.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                By default, any Class Descriptor terms that previously applied, but which will no longer apply, will be incorporated
                                in the Method Name.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                E.g. for Shakespeare Tower Block Minor, the Method Name is Shakespeare Tower, the Class Descriptor is Block, and the Stage is Minor.
                                Under the new framework the Class will change to "Surprise".  Block will therefore be added to the Method Name
                                such that the new Method Name will be Shakespeare Tower Block.  The Method Title will therefore become Shakespeare Tower Block Surprise Minor.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The default approach above may result in naming conflicts for some Methods, in which case the Central Council will
                                propose and publish new names.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If the band that named a method whose Classification will change under the new framework would like their Method named differently
                                from the approach above, they are invited to submit the proposed new name to the T&T Workgroup.
                            </p>

                                The Central Council will retroactively include these Peals in its analyses and records if it determines, based on good faith assessments of the available information about these Peals, that the requirements for a Peal under this framework were met.

                            <p>

                                the T&T Workgroup will forward the details of these Peals to The Ringing World for publication,
                                with the publication noting their retroactive recognition status.

                                the T&T Workgroup will ask The Ringing World to publish a notice
                                stating that these Peals have now been included in the Central Council's analyses and records,
                                and providing the references to the original publications by The Ringing World.

                                If a Peal was previously published by The Ringing World in a contrived manner that enabled it to be recognized as a Peal under the Decisions in place at the time,
                                the band may resubmit the Peal to The Ringing World for republication in the form that the band originally intended.
                                The republication will include a cross-reference to the original publication.

                                The Central Council maintains this framework and will periodically undertake transparent
                                review of it to ensure it continues to meet the needs of the ringing community.
