                                Under the Framework, a small percentage of Methods in the Methods Library may be reclassified, requiring a change
                                to their Method Title or Method Name.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                By default, any Class Descriptor terms that previously applied, but which will no longer apply, will be incorporated
                                in the Method Name.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                E.g. for Shakespeare Tower Block Minor, the Method Name is Shakespeare Tower, the Class Descriptor is Block, and the Stage is Minor.
                                Under the Framework the Class will change to "Surprise".  Block will therefore be added to the Method Name
                                such that the new Method Name will be Shakespeare Tower Block.  The Method Title will therefore become Shakespeare Tower Block Surprise Minor.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The default approach above may result in naming conflicts for some Methods, in which case the Central Council will
                                propose and publish new names.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If the band that named a method whose Classification will change under the Framework would like their Method named differently
                                from the approach above, they are invited to submit the proposed new name to the T&amp;T Workgroup.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                No changes to Method Titles are anticipated if Classification Alternative 4A is chosen. A full list of Methods that
                                would be retitled under Classification Alternative 4B is available <a href="altbmethodtitles.html"> here</a>.

                                The Central Council will retroactively include these Peals in its analyses and records if it determines, based on good faith assessments of the available information about these Peals, that the requirements for a Peal under the Framework were met.

                                the T&amp;T Workgroup will forward the details of these Peals to The Ringing World for publication,
                                with the publication noting their retroactive recognition status.

                                the T&amp;T Workgroup will ask The Ringing World to publish a notice
                                stating that these Peals have now been included in the Central Council's analyses and records,
                                and providing the references to the original publications by The Ringing World.

                            <p>
                                If a Peal was previously published by The Ringing World in an altered manner that enabled
                                it to be recognized as a Peal under the Decisions in place at the time,
                                and the Framework now enables the Peal to be recognized in the manner intended by the band,
                                then the band may resubmit the Peal to The Ringing World for republication in the form originally intended.
                                The republication will include a cross-reference to the original publication.
