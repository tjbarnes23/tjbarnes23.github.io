                                    <b>Further explanation:</b> Bells are uniquely numbered in descending order of pitch.
                                    Both cardinal numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3 ...) and ordinal numbers (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd ...) are used.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-primary">
                                    When using cardinals, number 1 is used for the bell with the highest pitch, number 2 for the next highest pitch and so on.
                                    When using ordinals, bell number 2 becomes 'the 2nd', bell number 3 becomes 'the 3rd', and so on.
                                    However bell number 1 is usually referred to as 'the treble' rather than 'the 1st', and the bell with the lowest pitch
                                    is usually referred to as 'the tenor' rather than the corresponding ordinal.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-primary">
                                    Bells are numbered relative to how many are in use.  For example, if a tower has eight bells but only the six with the lowest pitches are in use,
                                    these bells are numbered 1 to 6 instead of 3 to 8.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-primary">
                                    Rows are normally shown in columns so that the path of individual bells can be visualised by looking down the columns.
                                    In order to keep the columns aligned, a fixed font can be used with single characters representing each bell.
                                    Conventionally '0' (zero) is used to represent the 10th, and upper (or sometimes lower) case
                                    letters (excluding 'I', 'O' and 'X') are used for bells 11 to 33 as follows:

                                    <b>Technical comments:</b> While this definition of Row refers to a sequence of <i>bells</i>, a Row can
                                    comprise, at minimum, one bell.

                                	This definition of Row precludes cylindrical ringing, where a bell can appear twice in some
                                    Rows and not at all in other Rows.  Cylindrical ringing is considered beyond the scope of this framework -- it would
                                    likely require its own framework, with modified definitions in areas such as Truth.

                                    <b>Technical comments:</b> More formally, a Call is an instruction to replace zero or more Changes from one or

                                    A Composition normally will not specify fixed Cover Bells (for example, a Composition of Grandsire Caters doesn't specify that the tenor is always in 10th's place).
                                    However, in certain cases, such as a Composition of Doubles on the front 5, a fixed Cover Bell in 6th's place, and Minor on the back 6, the Composition could
                                    include fixed Cover Bells.
