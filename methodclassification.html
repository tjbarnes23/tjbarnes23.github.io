                                    <b>Further explanation:</b> The place notation recorded in the Central Council’s Method
                                    Library for the Method Plain Bob Minimus is x14x14x14x12.
                                    This place notation produces one Plain Lead when applied once to an initial Row.
                                    Using an initial Row of 1234 (Rounds), the Plain Lead shown in the diagram is produced.
                                    To identify which are the Hunt Bell(s), look at the final Row produced (in this example it is 1342).
                                    The Hunt Bell(s) are the bell(s) that are in the same Place(s) in the final Row as they were in the initial Row.
                                    In Plain Bob Minimus, the treble is therefore the only Hunt Bell.

                                    ends with the Row 31254, as shown in the diagram.
                                    At the end of one Plain Lead, no bell has returned to the Place it was in at the initial Row (12345),
                                    so this Method has no Hunt Bells.
                                    Continuing to apply the place notation successively produces the 5 additional leads shown,
                                    such that after 6 Plain Leads, Rounds is obtained.
                                    This is the Method’s Plain Course.
                                    It will be seen that bells 4 and 5 return to their starting Places at the end of the 2nd, 4th and 6th leads,
                                    whereas bells 1, 2 and 3 return to their starting Places at the end of the 3rd and 6th leads.
                                    Because the Working Bells do not all first return to their starting Places after the same number of Plain Leads, this Method is a Differential.
                                    Because it also has no Hunt Bells, it is a Differential Principle.
