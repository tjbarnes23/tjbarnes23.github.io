                                        Since the Performance was of Minor, the first Round Block
                                        was 720 Changes, the second Round Block was 1440 Changes, and the remaining Round Blocks were all 720 Changes.

                                        Treble Dodging may therefore optionally be included in the Performance Title

                                        In this example the Methods rung do not have the same Class Descriptors, and they are not all either Plain or Treble Dodging Methods.
                                        Therefore no Class names are used in the Performance Title, and the Method Names and Class Descriptors are included
                                        in the Performance Detail.
                                        In this example, abbreviations for Class Descriptors have been used (Diff S for Differential Surprise, LA for Little Alliance, etc),

                                        This example comprises 4 Methods and 2 Variations. The two Variations, April Day and Kennington, are based on Plain Bob,
                                        and so are members of the Plain Class.
                                        Variations do not use Class Descriptors, so this Performance doesn't have common Class Descriptor(s) that can be used in the
                                        Performance Title.
                                        However, Plain may optionally be included in the Performance Title since all Methods and Variations rung are members of this Class.
                                        Mixed has also optionally been used in the Performance Title since this is a multi-Method
                                        Performance, but doesn't include a Spliced Composition.
                                        (Given the optional terms, this Performance Title could be any of: 1320 Mixed Plain Doubles, 1320 Mixed Doubles, 1320 Plain Doubles, or 1320 Doubles.)

                                        Since this example is a multi-Stage Performance, the Stage Names are included in the Performance Detail.
                                        Also, although Plain Bob and Grandsire are both members of the Bob Class of Methods,
                                        Grandsire is an exception (see Section 5.F.1) in which the Bob Class Descriptor is not used.
                                        Bob therefore cannot be used in the Performance Title, but since St Clement's and Grandsire are both part of the Plain Class of Methods,
                                        Plain may optionally be included in the Performance Title (otherwise the Performance Title is 5040 Doubles and Minor).

                                        Martyrs Link has one Stationary Bell, and in this example, the Stationary Bell was not affected by any Calls.
                                        The Effective Stage of the Performance was therefore Triples.
                                        Since the Effective Stage is lower than the highest Stage of Method rung, the Performance Title and Performance Detail
                                        are constructed as above.

                                    In practice, the distinction in e) normally comes from separate reporting forms (e.g. on BellBoard)
                                    for handbells (2 bells per ringer) and tower bells (1 bell per ringer).
                                    However, if, for example, a handbell Performance was rung with 1 bell per ringer,
                                    this might look like a tower bell Performance on BellBoard, so e) gives the requirement
                                    to footnote that such a Performance was, in fact, rung in hand.

                                    <b>Further Explanation:</b> For norm g), assistance such as passing someone a bottle of water, opening a window,
                                    or turning on a light is not considered assistance in the execution of the ringing.

                                <p class="text-primary"> For norm k), if Methods with Jump Changes were used, this will be evident from 6.B.1 c) or d)
                                    above, since these Methods include 'Jump' in their Titles.
                                    Therefore disclosure relating to Jump Changes is only required if
                                    Jump Calls (i.e. Calls involving Jump Changes) or Variations with Jump Changes were used, but Jump Methods (i.e. Methods involving Jump Changes) were not. (Note that Variations don't use Class Descriptors, so a Variation with Jump Changes won't have 'Jump' in its Title.)
                                </p>

                                    For norm m), one person could ring a Performance of Minimus four in hand.
                                    The umpire provides corroboration that the Performance took place as reported.
                                    Note that if this norm is not followed (i.e. no umpire was present for a single person performance),
                                    this will be evident from 6.B.1 f) and g) above, so in practice no further disclosure is required.
