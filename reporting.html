                                        Since the Performance was of Minor, the first Round Block
                                        was 720 Changes, the second Round Block was 1440 Changes, and the remaining Round Blocks were all 720 Changes.

                                        Treble Dodging is therefore included in the Performance Title, and the Method Names and Class Descriptors are included

                                        Therefore no Class names are used in the Performance Title, and the Method Names and Class Descriptors are included

                                        This example comprises 4 Methods and 2 Variations. The two Variations, April Day and Kennington, are based on Plain Bob,
                                        and so are members of the Plain Class.
                                        Variations do not use Class Descriptors, so this Performance doesn't have common Class Descriptor(s) that can be used in the
                                        Performance Title.
                                        However, Plain is used in the Performance Title since all Methods and Variations are members of this Class.

                                        Since this example is a multi-Stage Performance, the Stage Names are included in the Performance Detail.
                                        Also, although Plain Bob and Grandsire are both members of the Bob Class of Methods,
                                        Grandsire is an exception (see Section 5.F.1) in which the Bob Class Descriptor is not used.
                                        Bob therefore cannot be used in the Performance Title, but since St Clement's and Grandsire are both part of the Plain Class of Methods,
                                        Plain is used in the Performance Title.

                                        Martyrs Link has one Stationary Bell, and in this example, the Stationary Bell was not affected by any Calls.
                                        The Effective Stage of the Performance was therefore Triples.
                                        Since the Effective Stage is lower than the highest Stage of Method rung, the Performance Title and Performance Detail
                                        are constructed as above.

                                g) No person not ringing provided any assistance in the execution of the ringing during the Performance,
                                    e.g. making calls, detecting or correcting errors;<br />
