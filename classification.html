                                	The classification system for method ringing evolved over many decades and as a result

                                	Making any large-scale changes to the classification system is problematic because
                                	class terms form part of a Method's Title (see Section 5.A.3), so changes to classifications
                                	also alter Method Titles, making it harder to interpret historical records of method ringing Performances.

                                    This place notation produces one Plain Lead when applied once to an initial Row.
                                    Using an initial Row of 1234 (Rounds), the Plain Lead shown in the diagram is produced.
                                    To identify which are the Hunt Bell(s), look at the final Row produced (in this example it is 1342).
                                    The Hunt Bell(s) are the bell(s) that are in the same Place(s) in the final Row as they were in the initial Row.
                                    In Plain Bob Minimus, the bell in 1st’s Place in the initial Row (in this example, the treble) is therefore the only Hunt Bell.

                                    <b>Further explanation:</b> Inverting the Places within a Change means to count the Places from the end of the Row rather than the beginning.
                                    For example, a Minor Change might have Places made in 1st's and 2nd's, so place notation = 12.
                                    1st's and 2nd's Places counted from the end of a Minor Row are 5th's and 6th's Places.
                                    So when the Minor Change 12 is inverted, the result is 56.
                                    Similarly, 14 becomes 36, and 34 becomes (in this case, remains) 34.

                                    If each of these Changes is inverted, the result is x16x14x12x16x36x56.

                                    At the end of one Plain Lead, the treble is the only bell that has returned to the Place it was in at the initial Row (1234),
                                    so the treble is this Method's only Hunt Bell.
                                    The other 3 bells are therefore Working Bells.
                                    Continuing to apply the place notation successively produces the 2 additional leads shown,
                                    such that after 3 Plain Leads, Rounds is obtained.
                                    This is the Method’s Plain Course.
                                    Since this Method has at least one Hunt Bell, it is a Hunter.

                                    ends with the Row 2341, as shown in the diagram.
                                    At the end of one Plain Lead, no bell has returned to the Place it was in at the initial Row (1234),

                                    such that after 4 Plain Leads, Rounds is obtained.
                                    This is the Method’s Plain Course.

                                    <b>Further explanation:</b> A Plain Lead of the Doubles Method 5.1.5.1.5.1.5.1.5.345, starting from rounds,
                                    ends with the Row 31254, as shown in the diagram.
                                    At the end of one Plain Lead, no bell has returned to the Place it was in at the initial Row (12345),
                                    so this Method has no Hunt Bells.  All bells are therefore Working Bells.
                                    Continuing to apply the place notation successively produces the 5 additional leads shown,
                                    such that after 6 Plain Leads, Rounds is obtained.
                                    This is the Method’s Plain Course.
                                    It will be seen that bells 4 and 5 return to their starting Places at the end of the 2nd, 4th and 6th leads,
                                    whereas bells 1, 2 and 3 return to their starting Places at the end of the 3rd and 6th leads.
                                    Since the Working Bells do not all first return to their starting Places after the same number of Plain Leads,
                                    this is a Differential Method.

                                	(unlike for single Hunt Bell Methods where a Hybrid Path is always asymmetric).
                                	An example of this is a Method in which a pair of Hunt Bells dodge together for the entire Plain Lead.

                                    has three Hunt bells in 1st's, 2nd's and 3rd's Places.
                                    All these Hunt Bells have Treble Dodging Paths, so the Method has a Treble Dodging classification.
                                    None of the Hunt Bells has a Little Path, so the Cross Section Changes are all the Changes that are
                                    Cross Section Changes for any of the three Hunt Bells.
                                    It can therefore be seen that every 4th change in this Method is a Cross Section Change.
                                    Since all of these Changes (16, 18, 30, 50, 70, and 14 at the lead end) include an Internal Place being made,
