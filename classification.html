                                    <b>Further explanation:</b> The place notation recorded in the Central Council’s Method
                                    Library for the Method Plain Bob Minimus is x14x14x14x12.
                                    This place notation produces one Plain Lead when applied once to an initial Row.
                                    Using an initial Row of 1234 (Rounds), the Plain Lead shown in the diagram is produced.
                                    To identify which are the Hunt Bell(s), look at the final Row produced (in this example it is 1342).
                                    The Hunt Bell(s) are the bell(s) that are in the same Place(s) in the final Row as they were in the initial Row.
                                    In Plain Bob Minimus, the bell in 1st’s Place in the initial Row (in this example, the treble) is therefore the only Hunt Bell.

                                    At the end of one Plain Lead, no bell has returned to the Place it was in at the initial Row (12345),
                                    so this Method has no Hunt Bells.  All bells are therefore Working Bells.
                                    Continuing to apply the place notation successively produces the 5 additional leads shown,
                                    such that after 6 Plain Leads, Rounds is obtained.
                                    This is the Method’s Plain Course.
                                    It will be seen that bells 4 and 5 return to their starting Places at the end of the 2nd, 4th and 6th leads,
                                    whereas bells 1, 2 and 3 return to their starting Places at the end of the 3rd and 6th leads.
                                    Because the Working Bells do not all first return to their starting Places after the same number of Plain Leads, this Method is a Differential.
                                    Because it also has no Hunt Bells, it is a Differential Principle.

                                    The Places Made at both Cross Sections are 1st's and 6th's, which are external Places.
                                    Since this Method has palindromic symmetry (the Place Notation for the
                                    second half of the lead is the reverse of the Place Notation for the first half of the lead)
                                    there is no need to check the Cross Sections in the second half of the lead as these will have the same
                                    Places Made as in the first half of the lead.
                                    However for asymmetric (i.e. non-palindromic) Methods,
                                    all Cross Sections must be considered when further classifying a Treble Dodging method.

                                    <b>Further explanation:</b> An Internal Place is Made at the 2-3 Cross Section of this Treble Dodging Method,
                                    but an Internal Place is not made at the 4-5 Cross Section (the Cross Sections are cicled in green).
                                    (See the note about palindromic symmetry in Section C.2.1 above, which applies here.)
                                    Since Internal Places are Made at some but not all Cross Section Changes,
                                    this Method is therefore a Delight Method.
                                    (This Method is College Bob IV Delight Minor.)
