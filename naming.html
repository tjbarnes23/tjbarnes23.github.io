                                    by starting and finishing the existing Static Method at a different point in its sequence of Changes.

                                and will normally only be recorded under one name in the Method Library.

                                    <b>Further explanation:</b> When using a Static Method's sequence of Changes to produce Rows, the Changes
                                    may be used starting and finishing at any point in the sequence.  For this reason, a Rotation of
                                    an existing Static Method is not usually separately named, because the same Changes can be produced
                                    by starting and finishing the existing Static Method at a different point in its sequence of Changes.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-primary"> An example where separate naming of Rotations is beneficial is for twin hunt methods like Grandsire Triples.
                                    When rotated so that the second hunt bell is the treble, and rung with Grandsire calls affecting the first hunt bell rather than the second,
                                    it seems like a different method. This rotation has been rung many times under the name New Grandsire (7.1.7.1.7.1.7.1.7.1.7.1.3.1)
                                    and has also been spliced with Grandsire.
                                    Separate inclusion of New Grandsire in the Method Library is therefore considered beneficial.

                                    representing one Plain Lead.  This Method would have two Plain Leads in its Plain Course.
                                    However, since this sequence of Changes is divisible into two equal parts (each with place notation
                                    34x34.14.12.14), it would normally be recorded in the Method Library as the sequence 34x34.14.12.14,
                                    thus a Method with four Plain Leads in its Plain Course.  The longer place notation shown above can be
                                    obtained simply by using two Plain Leads of the shorter Method.

                                    notation is x16x16x16x16x16x16.  This is recorded in the Method Library as the Method called Original
                                    with place notation x16.  But since Plain Hunt is widely used and recognized as a Method Name,
                                    it is considered beneficial for Plain Hunt to be recorded as a Method in the Method Library, in addition to Original.
