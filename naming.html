                                Rotations of an existing Static Method are not normally separately named in the Methods Library.
                                However, this is not mandated as there are a few cases where it is beneficial

                                    <b>Further explanation:</b> When using a Static Method's sequence of Changes to produce Rows, the Changes
                                    may be used starting and finishing at any point in the sequence.  For this reason, a Rotation of
                                    an existing Static Method is not usually separately named, because the same Changes can be produced
                                    by starting and finishing the existing Static Method at a different point in its sequence of Changes.
                                </p>

                                <p class="text-primary"> An example where separate naming of Rotations is beneficial is for twin hunt methods like Grandsire Triples.
                                    When Rotated so that the second Hunt Bell is the treble, and rung with Grandsire Calls affecting the first Hunt Bell rather than the second,
                                    it seems like a different method. This Rotation has been rung many times under the name New Grandsire (7.1.7.1.7.1.7.1.7.1.7.1.3.1)
                                    and has also been spliced with Grandsire.
                                    It is therefore beneficial to include New Grandsire in the Methods Library, and
                                    when splicing it with Grandsire, there is a clear way to announce changes of Method.

                                    been used to prefix Method Names when certain Method features are present.
                                    Use of these terms is optional, but if used, they should follow the requirements
                                    in a) - c) below.
                                    Similarly, terms such as 'True', 'Symmetric' and 'Palindromic' should not be used in
                                    Method Names where these could mislead.

                                    (ii) The Method with the 'Double' prefix is a Double Method (that is, when the Places of each Change are
