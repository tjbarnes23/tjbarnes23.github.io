                                	The classification system for method ringing evolved over many decades and as a result
                                	is more complex than if we were starting from scratch.
                                	Making any significant changes to the classification system is problematic because
                                	class terms form part of a Method's Title (see Section 5.A.3), so changes to classifications
                                	alter Method Titles, making it harder to interpret historic records of method ringing Performances.

                                    This place notation produces one Plain Lead when applied once to an initial Row.
                                    Using an initial Row of 1234 (Rounds), the Plain Lead shown in the diagram is produced.
                                    To identify which are the Hunt Bell(s), look at the final Row produced (in this example it is 1342).
                                    The Hunt Bell(s) are the bell(s) that are in the same Place(s) in the final Row as they were in the initial Row.
                                    In Plain Bob Minimus, the bell in 1st’s Place in the initial Row (in this example, the treble) is therefore the only Hunt Bell.

                                    <b>Further explanation:</b> Inverting the Places within a Change means to count the Places from the end of the Row rather than the beginning.
                                    For example, a Minor Change might have Places made in 1st's and 2nd's, so place notation = 12.
                                    1st's and 2nd's Places counted from the end of a Minor Row are 5th's and 6th's Places.
                                    So when the Minor Change 12 is inverted, the result is 56.
                                    Similarly, 14 becomes 36, and 34 becomes 34.

                                    If each of these Changes is inverted, the result is x36x16x12x14x16x56.
                                    This can be Rotated to give x14x16x56x36x16x12, which is the same sequence as above.

                                Hunters are sub-classified as below, based primarily on the Path of the bell in 1st's Place at the initial Row of a Plain Lead.
                                Methods are normally rung starting from Rounds, so the bell in 1st's Place is the treble.  The definitions below therefore use 'treble'
                                as shorthand for 'the bell in 1st's Place'.

                                    Since this Method has Palindromic Symmetry (see 4.B.2 above)
                                    there is no need to check the Cross Sections in the second half of the lead as these will have the same
                                    Places Made as in the first half of the lead.
                                    However for non-palindromic Methods,
                                    all Cross Sections must be considered when further classifying a Treble Dodging method.
