                                    Bells are uniquely numbered in descending order of pitch.
                                    Both cardinal numbers (e.g. 1, 2, 3 ...) and ordinal numbers (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd ...) are used.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p class="text-primary">
                                    When using cardinals, number 1 is used for the bell with the highest pitch, number 2 for the next highest pitch and so on.
                                    When using ordinals, bell number 2 becomes 'the 2nd', bell number 3 becomes 'the 3rd', and so on.
                                    However bell number 1 is usually referred to as 'the treble' rather than 'the 1st', and the bell with the lowest pitch
                                    is usually referred to as 'the tenor' rather than the corresponding ordinal.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-primary">
                                    Bells are numbered relative to how many are in use.  For example, if a tower has eight bells but only the six with the lowest pitches are in use,
                                    these bells are numbered 1 to 6 instead of 3 to 8.
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-primary">
                                    Rows are normally shown in columns so that the path of individual bells can be visualised by looking down the columns.
                                    In order to keep the columns aligned, a fixed font can be used with single characters representing each bell.
                                    Conventionally '0' (zero) is used to represent the 10th, and upper (or sometimes lower) case
                                    letters (excluding 'I', 'O' and 'X') are used for bells 11 to 33 as follows:

                                    (a) if the Treble is leading after an x Change, replace the next 16 Change with a 12 Change, and

                                    sequence of Changes is therefore not fixed, and so Dixon's Bob Minor is an example of

                                    In the example above, the Doubles Composition is applied to Places 1 to 5 so that 6th's Place contains a Cover Bell.
                                    The tenor as Cover Bell is the usual implementation when the Stage of a Block is one higher than the Stage of a Composition.

                                    Since Cover Bells can be generated by using a Composition of a given Stage to produce a
                                    Block of a higher Stage, Compositions often do not need to specify the transposition of Cover Bells as these are inferred.
                                    However, since the Changes produced by a Composition are all of the same Stage,
                                    there is a second scenario where a Composition's Changes include the transposition of Cover Bells for some or all Changes.

                                    For example, if a Composition uses a Doubles Method initially, applying to Places 1 to 5,
                                    and then switches to a Minor Method, applying to Places 1 to 6, then the Composition's Changes are all specified
                                    as Minor Changes, with a place notation of "6" added to all Doubles Changes.  This Composition therefore has a Stage of Minor.

								<p class="text-primary">
                                	Similarly, a Composition might use a Doubles Method but is designed to produce a Minor Block, and Calls
                                	are used that occasionally exchange the Cover Bell in 6th's Place.  In this case the Composition's Changes
                                	are all specified as Minor Changes (so the Composition's Stage is Minor), with a place notation of "6" added to all Changes where the Cover Bell is not affected.
                                	For example, if the Composition's Doubles Method has a "3" Change, this becomes a "36" Change in the Composition. 
                                	Where the Cover Bell is affected by a Call, what otherwise might have been a "36" Change might instead become a "34" Change.

                                    <b>Technical comments:</b> As discussed above under Compositions (Section 3.G), it is possible for a Composition
                                    to use two or more Methods side by side, or to use two or more Compositions side by side.
                                    As a further variation, a Composition might also result in an interior Cover Bell.
                                    For example, a Composition might be designed to be used with Maximus Rows, using a Doubles Method in Places 1 to 5
                                    and a Minor Method in Places 7 to 12.
                                    6th's Place does not have any Methods operating on it, and therefore 6th's Place contains a Cover Bell.
                                    In this case, the Composition would produce Maximus Changes (and therefore have a Stage of Maximus),
                                    and each of its Changes would include the place notation "6".

                                A Touch has Accepted Truth if:<br />
                                a) It is rung on n bells;<br />
                                b) It comprises (x) Round Block(s) with an Effective Stage of n and
                                    (y) Round Block(s) with an Effective Stage of n-1 and with nth's Place a Fixed Place;<br />
                                c) The Rows in (x) and (y) are True when considered independently using the definition of True in Section 3.J.4; and<br/>
                                d) The Rows in (x) contain at least one Extent at Stage n.

                                    <b>Futher explanation:</b> Accepted Truth applies most commonly to Touches of Doubles and Minor rung on 6 bells.
                                    The bell in 6th's Place when ringing Doubles is a Cover Bell that is not affected by any Calls (i.e. 6th's Place is a Fixed Place).
                                    Changes of Stage may only occur at the end of a Round Block (which will be the same Row as the initial Row).
                                    If the Doubles Rows taken together are True, and the Minor Rows taken together are True,
                                    then the Touch has Accepted Truth.
                                    Note that a Row occuring at a change of Stage (which will be the same as the initial Row since changes of Stage only occur at the end
                                    of a Round Block) is counted as a Row of the following Round Block when 
                                    determining Truth at the individual Stages.
                                    The initial Row is counted as part of the first Round Block when determining Truth at the individual Stages,
                                    and the final Row is excluded.
